	mod_but Installation:

	November 11, 2006
=====================================================

Please refer to the PDF file for a complete installation guide.



This description only includes a HowTo for compiling mod_but as DSO with Unix
=============================================================================
Do the following:

	a) cd into the modules/mod_but directory; Edit Makefile to point the variable APXS to your real location
	b) Edit the Makefile to configure APXSFLAGS (-c = compile, -i = install, -a = modify httpd.conf) 
	c) type "make" in modules/mod_but directory
	
If you don't like the Makefile, you can do everything by hand. Use the Makefile as reference.
