The TODO list for this project is maintained in the sourceforge project page at:
	- http://sourceforge.net/pm/?group_id=170274
	
The TODO list is divided into many sub-lists. At the moment of writing this file, we are working
on the tasks included in "TODO v1.00" ; after that we will continue with "TODO v1.10" and so on. 
We are also working on "Plugin TODO" and after finishing those tasks we will continue with "Plugin 
TODO v1.20".

They are a lot of tasks available, they range from documentation review and simple coding stuff to 
complex web application exploitation plugins; so if you are looking to learn how to create better code, 
or simply demonstrate that you can code complex plugins do not hesitate to contact me 
( andres.riancho _at_ gmail.com ) in order to contribute.
