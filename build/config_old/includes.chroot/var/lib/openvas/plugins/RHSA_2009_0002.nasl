advisory RHSA-2009:0002.

Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed HTML mail content.
An HTML mail message containing malicious content could cause Thunderbird
to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code as the user running
Thunderbird. (CVE-2008-5500, CVE-2008-5501, CVE-2008-5502, CVE-2008-5511,
CVE-2008-5512, CVE-2008-5513)

Several flaws were found in the way malformed content was processed. An
HTML mail message containing specially-crafted content could potentially
trick a Thunderbird user into surrendering sensitive information.
(CVE-2008-5503, CVE-2008-5506, CVE-2008-5507)

Note: JavaScript support is disabled by default in Thunderbird; the above
issues are not exploitable unless JavaScript is enabled.

A flaw was found in the way malformed URLs were processed by
Thunderbird. This flaw could prevent various URL sanitization mechanisms
from properly parsing a malicious URL. (CVE-2008-5508)

All Thunderbird users should upgrade to these updated packages, which
resolve these issues. All running instances of Thunderbird must be
restarted for the update to take effect.";
