CVE-2008-2371
Heap-based buffer overflow in pcre_compile.c in the Perl-Compatible
Regular Expression (PCRE) library 7.7 allows context-dependent
attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly execute
arbitrary code via a regular expression that begins with an option and
contains multiple branches.
CVE-2008-2829
php_imap.c in PHP 5.2.5, 5.2.6, 4.x, and other versions, uses obsolete
API calls that allow context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of
service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a long IMAP
request, which triggers an 'rfc822.c legacy routine buffer overflow'
error message.
CVE-2008-3658
Buffer overflow in the imageloadfont function in ext/gd/gd.c in PHP
4.4.x before 4.4.9 and PHP 5.2 before 5.2.6-r6 allows
context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and
possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted font file.
CVE-2008-3659
Buffer overflow in the memnstr function in PHP 4.4.x before 4.4.9 and
PHP 5.6 through 5.2.6 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a
denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via the
delimiter argument to the explode function.  NOTE: the scope of this
issue is limited since most applications would not use an
attacker-controlled delimiter, but local attacks against safe_mode are
feasible.
CVE-2008-3660
PHP 4.4.x before 4.4.9, and 5.x through 5.2.6, when used as a FastCGI
module, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash)
via a request with multiple dots preceding the extension, as
demonstrated using foo..php.";
