tag_insight = "The rpmdrake package, which provides the graphical software
  installation and update tools rpmdrake, drakrpm-edit-media and
  MandrivaUpdate), included with Mandriva Linux 2007 Spring contains
  several bugs. These include:

  When installing software with rpmdrake, if packages are selected for
  installation which require other packages to be installed as well,
  a message will be displayed that says To satisfy dependencies,
  the following packages also need to be installed:, but no list of
  dependencies will actually be shown.
  
  When installing software with rpmdrake, searching for a package always
  searches through the full set of available packages even when a search
  filter - such as All updates or Mandriva choices - is selected.
  
  When installing software with rpmdrake, when you switch between two
  subsections with the same name - for instance, System/Settings/Other
  and Development/Other - the list of packages is not updated; in
  the example, the packages from the System/Settings/Other group
  will continue to be displayed, instead of the packages from
  Development/Other.
  
  Running rpmdrake with the --merge-all-rpmnew parameter, which uses
  rpmdrake to help you merge changes in updated configuration files,
  does not work.
  
  When updating your system with MandrivaUpdate, when a package name
  cannot be correctly parsed, the name of the previous package in the
  list will be displayed again instead.
  
  When installing software with rpmdrake, the application will crash
  if a package with a malformed summary in the Unicode text encoding
  system was selected.
  
  Some other, more minor bugs were also fixed in this update.";
