Ubuntu 8.10:
  icedtea6-plugin                 6b12-0ubuntu6.4
  openjdk-6-jdk                   6b12-0ubuntu6.4
  openjdk-6-jre                   6b12-0ubuntu6.4

  openjdk-6-jre-lib               6b12-0ubuntu6.4

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart any Java applications
to effect the necessary changes.

If a user were tricked into loading a malicious program or applet,
a remote attacker could consume disk space, leading to a denial of
service. (CVE-2006-2426, CVE-2009-1100)

It was discovered that the lightweight HttpServer did not correctly close
files on dataless connections.  A remote attacker could send specially
crafted requests, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2009-1101)

Certain 64bit Java actions would crash an application.  A local attacker
might be able to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2009-1102)

It was discovered that LDAP connections did not close correctly.
A remote attacker could send specially crafted requests, leading to a
denial of service.  (CVE-2009-1093)

Java LDAP routines did not unserialize certain data correctly.  A remote
attacker could send specially crafted requests that could lead to
arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2009-1094)

Java did not correctly check certain JAR headers.  If a user or
automated system were tricked into processing a malicious JAR file,
a remote attacker could crash the application, leading to a denial of
service. (CVE-2009-1095, CVE-2009-1096)

It was discovered that PNG and GIF decoding in Java could lead to memory
corruption.  If a user or automated system were tricked into processing
a specially crafted image, a remote attacker could crash the application,
leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2009-1097, CVE-2009-1098)";
