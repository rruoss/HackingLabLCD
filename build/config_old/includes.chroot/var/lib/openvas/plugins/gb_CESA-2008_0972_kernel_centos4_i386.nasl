tag_insight = "The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  * a flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Direct-IO implementation. This
  could have allowed a local unprivileged user to cause a denial of service.
  (CVE-2007-6716, Important)
  
  * when running ptrace in 31-bit mode on an IBM S/390 or IBM System z
  kernel, a local unprivileged user could cause a denial of service by
  reading from or writing into a padding area in the user_regs_struct32
  structure. (CVE-2008-1514, Important)
  
  * the do_truncate() and generic_file_splice_write() functions did not clear
  the setuid and setgid bits. This could have allowed a local unprivileged
  user to obtain access to privileged information. (CVE-2008-4210, Important)
  
  * Tobias Klein reported a missing check in the Linux kernel's Open Sound
  System (OSS) implementation. This deficiency could have led to an
  information leak. (CVE-2008-3272, Moderate)
  
  * a potential denial of service attack was discovered in the Linux kernel's
  PWC USB video driver. A local unprivileged user could have used this flaw
  to bring the kernel USB subsystem into the busy-waiting state.
  (CVE-2007-5093, Low)
  
  * the ext2 and ext3 file systems code failed to properly handle corrupted
  data structures, leading to a possible local denial of service issue when
  read or write operations were performed. (CVE-2008-3528, Low)
  
  In addition, these updated packages fix the following bugs:
  
  * when using the CIFS &quot;forcedirectio&quot; option, appending to an open file on
  a CIFS share resulted in that file being overwritten with the data to be
  appended.
  
  * a kernel panic occurred when a device with PCI ID 8086:10c8 was present
  on a system with a loaded ixgbe driver.
  
  * due to an aacraid driver regression, the kernel failed to boot when trying
  to load the aacraid driver and printed the following error message:
  &quot;aac_srb: aac_fib_send failed with status: 8195&quot;.
  
  * due to an mpt driver regression, when RAID 1 was configured on Primergy
  systems with an LSI SCSI IME 53C1020/1030 controller, the kernel panicked
  during boot.
  
  * the mpt driver produced a large number of extraneous debugging messages
  when performing a &quot;Host reset&quot; operation.
  
  * due to a regression in the sym driver, the kernel panicked when a SCSI
  hot swap was performed using MCP18 hardware.
  
  * all cores on a multi-core system now scale their frequencies in
  accordance with the policy set by the system's CPU frequency governor.
  
  * the netdump subsystem suffered from several stability issues. These  ...
