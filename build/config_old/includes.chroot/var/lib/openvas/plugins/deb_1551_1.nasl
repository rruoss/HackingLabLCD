tag_insight = "Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the interpreter for the
Python language. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:

CVE-2007-2052

Piotr Engelking discovered that the strxfrm() function of the locale
module miscalculates the length of an internal buffer, which may
result in a minor information disclosure.

CVE-2007-4965

It was discovered that several integer overflows in the imageop
module may lead to the execution of arbitrary code, if a user is
tricked into processing malformed images. This issue is also
tracked as CVE-2008-1679 due to an initially incomplete patch.

CVE-2008-1721

Justin Ferguson discovered that a buffer overflow in the zlib
module may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2008-1887

Justin Ferguson discovered that insufficient input validation in
PyString_FromStringAndSize() may lead to the execution of arbitrary
code.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.4.4-3+etch1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.4.5-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your python2.4 packages.";
