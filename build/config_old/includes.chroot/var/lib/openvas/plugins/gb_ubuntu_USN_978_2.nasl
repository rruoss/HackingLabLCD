tag_insight = "USN-978-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Thunderbird. Some users reported
  stability problems under certain circumstances. This update fixes the
  problem.

  We apologize for the inconvenience.

  Original advisory details:

  Several dangling pointer vulnerabilities were discovered in Thunderbird. An
  attacker could exploit this to crash Thunderbird or possibly run arbitrary
  code as the user invoking the program. (CVE-2010-2760, CVE-2010-2767,
  CVE-2010-3167)

  It was discovered that the XPCSafeJSObjectWrapper (SJOW) security wrapper
  did not always honor the same-origin policy. If JavaScript was enabled, an
  attacker could exploit this to run untrusted JavaScript from other domains.
  (CVE-2010-2763)
  
  Matt Haggard discovered that Thunderbird did not honor same-origin policy
  when processing the statusText property of an XMLHttpRequest object. If a
  user were tricked into viewing a malicious site, a remote attacker could
  use this to gather information about servers on internal private networks.
  (CVE-2010-2764)
  
  Chris Rohlf discovered an integer overflow when Thunderbird processed the
  HTML frameset element. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious
  site, a remote attacker could use this to crash Thunderbird or possibly run
  arbitrary code as the user invoking the program. (CVE-2010-2765)
  
  Several issues were discovered in the browser engine. If a user were
  tricked into viewing a malicious site, a remote attacker could use this to
  crash Thunderbird or possibly run arbitrary code as the user invoking the
  program. (CVE-2010-2766, CVE-2010-3168)
  
  David Huang and Collin Jackson discovered that the &lt;object&gt; tag could
  override the charset of a framed HTML document in another origin. An
  attacker could utilize this to perform cross-site scripting attacks.
  (CVE-2010-2768)
  
  Paul Stone discovered that with designMode enabled an HTML selection
  containing JavaScript could be copied and pasted into a document and have
  the JavaScript execute within the context of the site where the code was
  dropped. If JavaScript was enabled, an attacker could utilize this to
  perform cross-site scripting attacks. (CVE-2010-2769)
  
  A buffer overflow was discovered in Thunderbird when processing text runs.
  If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious site, a remote attacker
  could use this to crash Thunderbird or possibly run arbitrary code as the
  user invoking the program. (CVE-2010-3166)
  
  Peter Van der Beken, Jason Oster, Jesse Ruderman, Igor Bukanov, Jeff
  Walden, Gary Kwong and Olli Pettay discovered several flaws i ...
