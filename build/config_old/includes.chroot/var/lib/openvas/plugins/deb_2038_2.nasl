tag_insight = "The packages for Pidgin released as DSA 2038-1 had a regression, as they
unintentionally disabled the Zephyr instant messaging protocol. This
update restores Zephyr functionality. For reference the original
advisory text below.

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in Pidgin, a multi
protocol instant messaging client. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2010-0420

Crafted nicknames in the XMPP protocol can crash Pidgin remotely.

CVE-2010-0423

Remote contacts may send too many custom smilies, crashing Pidgin.

Since a few months, Microsoft's servers for MSN have changed the protocol,
making Pidgin non-functional for use with MSN. It is not feasible to port
these changes to the version of Pidgin in Debian Lenny. This update
formalises that situation by disabling the protocol in the client. Users
of the MSN protocol are advised to use the version of Pidgin in the
repositories of www.backports.org.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.4.3-4lenny7.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.6.6-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your pidgin package.";
