advisory RHSA-2009:0256.

Mozilla Firefox is an open source Web browser.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code as the user running Firefox.
(CVE-2009-0352, CVE-2009-0353, CVE-2009-0356)

Several flaws were found in the way malformed content was processed. A
website containing specially-crafted content could, potentially, trick a
Firefox user into surrendering sensitive information. (CVE-2009-0354,
CVE-2009-0355)

A flaw was found in the way Firefox treated HTTPOnly cookies. An attacker
able to execute arbitrary JavaScript on a target site using HTTPOnly
cookies may be able to use this flaw to steal the cookie. (CVE-2009-0357)

A flaw was found in the way Firefox treated certain HTTP page caching
directives. A local attacker could steal the contents of sensitive pages
which the page author did not intend to be cached. (CVE-2009-0358)

For technical details regarding these flaws, please see the Mozilla
security advisories for Firefox 3.0.6. You can find a link to the Mozilla
advisories in the References section.

All Firefox users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
Firefox version 3.0.6, which corrects these issues. After installing the
update, Firefox must be restarted for the changes to take effect.";
