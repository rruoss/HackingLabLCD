tag_insight = "LFTP is a sophisticated file transfer program for the FTP and HTTP
  protocols. Like Bash, it has job control and uses the Readline library for
  input. It has bookmarks, built-in mirroring, and can transfer several files
  in parallel. It is designed with reliability in mind.

  It was discovered that lftp trusted the file name provided in the
  Content-Disposition HTTP header. A malicious HTTP server could use this
  flaw to write or overwrite files in the current working directory of a
  victim running lftp, by sending a different file from what the victim
  requested. (CVE-2010-2251)
  
  To correct this flaw, the following changes were made to lftp: the
  &quot;xfer:clobber&quot; option now defaults to &quot;no&quot;, causing lftp to not overwrite
  existing files, and a new option, &quot;xfer:auto-rename&quot;, which defaults to
  &quot;no&quot;, has been introduced to control whether lftp should use
  server-suggested file names. Refer to the &quot;Settings&quot; section of the lftp(1)
  manual page for additional details on changing lftp settings.
  
  All lftp users should upgrade to this updated package, which contains a
  backported patch to correct this issue.";
