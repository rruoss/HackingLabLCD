CVE-2011-4108
The DTLS implementation in OpenSSL before 0.9.8s and 1.x before 1.0.0f
performs a MAC check only if certain padding is valid, which makes it
easier for remote attackers to recover plaintext via a padding oracle
attack.

CVE-2011-4109
Double free vulnerability in OpenSSL 0.9.8 before 0.9.8s, when
X509_V_FLAG_POLICY_CHECK is enabled, allows remote attackers to have
an unspecified impact by triggering failure of a policy check.

CVE-2011-4576
The SSL 3.0 implementation in OpenSSL before 0.9.8s and 1.x before
1.0.0f does not properly initialize data structures for block cipher
padding, which might allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive
information by decrypting the padding data sent by an SSL peer.

CVE-2011-4577
OpenSSL before 0.9.8s and 1.x before 1.0.0f, when RFC 3779 support is
enabled, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(assertion failure) via an X.509 certificate containing
certificate-extension data associated with (1) IP address blocks or
(2) Autonomous System (AS) identifiers.

CVE-2011-4619
The Server Gated Cryptography (SGC) implementation in OpenSSL before
0.9.8s and 1.x before 1.0.0f does not properly handle handshake
restarts, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
via unspecified vectors.

CVE-2012-0027
The GOST ENGINE in OpenSSL before 1.0.0f does not properly handle
invalid parameters for the GOST block cipher, which allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via crafted data
from a TLS client.";
