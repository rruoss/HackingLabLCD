tag_insight = "pt_chown is a setuid root support utility used by grantpt(3) to change
ownership of a tty.

openpty(3) is a support function in libutil which is used to obtain a
pseudo-terminal.

script(1) is a utility which makes a typescript of everything printed
on a terminal.

Two issues exist in the FreeBSD pty handling.

If openpty(3) is called as non-root user the newly created
pseudo-terminal is world readable and writeable.  While this is
documented to be the case, script(1) still uses openpty(3) and
script(1) may be used by non-root users [CVE-2008-0217].

The ptsname(3) function incorrectly extracts two characters from the
name of a device node in /dev without verifying that it's actually
operating on a valid pty which the calling user owns.  pt_chown uses
the bad result from ptsname(3) to change ownership of a pty to the
user calling pt_chown [CVE-2008-0216].";
