tag_insight = "Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in mapserver, a CGI-based
web framework to publish spatial data and interactive mapping applications.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:

CVE-2009-0843

Missing input validation on a user supplied map queryfile name can be
used by an attacker to check for the existence of a specific file by
using the queryfile GET parameter and checking for differences in error
messages.

CVE-2009-0842

A lack of file type verification when parsing a map file can lead to
partial disclosure of content from arbitrary files through parser error
messages.

CVE-2009-0841

Due to missing input validation when saving map files under certain
conditions it is possible to perform directory traversal attacks and
to create arbitrary files.
NOTE: Unless the attacker is able to create directories in the image
path or there is already a readable directory this doesn't affect
installations on Linux as the fopen() syscall will fail in case a sub
path is not readable.

CVE-2009-0839

It was discovered that mapserver is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer
overflow when processing certain GET parameters.  An attacker can use
this to execute arbitrary code on the server via crafted id parameters.

CVE-2009-0840

An integer overflow leading to a heap-based buffer overflow when
processing the Content-Length header of an HTTP request can be used by an
attacker to execute arbitrary code via crafted POST requests containing
negative Content-Length values.

CVE-2009-2281

An integer overflow when processing HTTP requests can lead to a
heap-based buffer overflow. An attacker can use this to execute arbitrary
code either via crafted Content-Length values or large HTTP request. This
is partly because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2009-0840.


For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.10.0-5.1+etch4.

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.0.3-3+lenny4.

For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.4.2-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.4.2-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your mapserver packages.";
