  operating system.

  Security fixes:
  
  * a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Linux kernel NFSv4
  implementation. Several of the NFSv4 file locking functions failed to check
  whether a file had been opened on the server before performing locking
  operations on it. A local, unprivileged user on a system with an NFSv4
  share mounted could possibly use this flaw to cause a kernel panic (denial
  of service) or escalate their privileges. (CVE-2009-3726, Important)
  
  * a flaw was found in the sctp_process_unk_param() function in the Linux
  kernel Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) implementation. A remote
  attacker could send a specially-crafted SCTP packet to an SCTP listening
  port on a target system, causing a kernel panic (denial of service).
  (CVE-2010-1173, Important)
  
  * a race condition between finding a keyring by name and destroying a freed
  keyring was found in the Linux kernel key management facility. A local,
  unprivileged user could use this flaw to cause a kernel panic (denial of
  service) or escalate their privileges. (CVE-2010-1437, Important)
  
  Red Hat would like to thank Simon Vallet for responsibly reporting
  CVE-2009-3726; and Jukka Taimisto and Olli Jarva of Codenomicon Ltd, Nokia
  Siemens Networks, and Wind River on behalf of their customer, for
  responsibly reporting CVE-2010-1173.
  
  Bug fixes:
  
  * RHBA-2007:0791 introduced a regression in the Journaling Block Device
  (JBD). Under certain circumstances, removing a large file (such as 300 MB
  or more) did not result in inactive memory being freed, leading to the
  system having a large amount of inactive memory. Now, the memory is
  correctly freed. (BZ#589155)
  
  * the timer_interrupt() routine did not scale lost real ticks to logical
  ticks correctly, possibly causing time drift for 64-bit Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 4 KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) guests that were booted with the
  &quot;divider=x&quot; kernel parameter set to a value greater than 1. &quot;warning: many
  lost ticks&quot; messages may have been logged on the affected guest systems.
  (BZ#590551)
  
  * a bug could have prevented NFSv3 clients from having the most up-to-date
  file attributes for files on a given NFSv3 file system. In cases where a
  file type changed, such as if a file was removed and replaced with a
  directory of the same name, the NFSv3 client may not have noticed this
  change until stat(2) was ca ...
