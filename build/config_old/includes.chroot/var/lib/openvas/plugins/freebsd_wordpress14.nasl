WordPress before 3.3.2 has unknown impact and attack vectors.
CVE-2012-2400
Unspecified vulnerability in wp-includes/js/swfobject.js in WordPress
before 3.3.2 has unknown impact and attack vectors.
CVE-2012-2401
Plupload before 1.5.4, as used in wp-includes/js/plupload/ in

authenticated site administrators to bypass intended access
restrictions and deactivate network-wide plugins via unspecified

remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via
unspecified vectors.
CVE-2012-2404
wp-comments-post.php in WordPress before 3.3.2 supports offsite
redirects, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct
