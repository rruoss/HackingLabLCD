tag_solution = "For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.5.7+r1558-4+sarge2.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.6.1+r1642-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your elog package.

tag_summary = "The remote host is missing an update to elog
announced via advisory DSA 967-1.

Several security problems have been found in elog, an electonic logbook
to manage notes.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project
identifies the following problems:

CVE-2005-4439

GroundZero Security discovered that elog insufficiently checks the
size of a buffer used for processing URL parameters, which might lead
to the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2006-0347

It was discovered that elog contains a directory traveral vulnerability
in the processing of ../ sequences in URLs, which might lead to
information disclosure.

CVE-2006-0348

The code to write the log file contained a format string vulnerability,
which might lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2006-0597

Overly long revision attributes might trigger a crash due to a buffer
overflow.

CVE-2006-0598

The code to write the log file does not enforce bounds checks properly,
which might lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2006-0599

elog emitted different errors messages for invalid passwords and invalid
users, which allows an attacker to probe for valid user names.

CVE-2006-0600

An attacker could be driven into infinite redirection with a crafted
fail request, which has denial of service potential.

The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain elog packages.";
