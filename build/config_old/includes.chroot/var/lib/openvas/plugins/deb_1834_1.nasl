tag_insight = "A denial of service flaw was found in the Apache mod_proxy module when
it was used as a reverse proxy. A remote attacker could use this flaw
to force a proxy process to consume large amounts of CPU time. This
issue did not affect Debian 4.0 etch. (CVE-2009-1890)

A denial of service flaw was found in the Apache mod_deflate module.
This module continued to compress large files until compression was
complete, even if the network connection that requested the content
was closed before compression completed. This would cause mod_deflate
to consume large amounts of CPU if mod_deflate was enabled for a large
file. A similar flaw related to HEAD requests for compressed content
was also fixed. (CVE-2009-1891)

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.2.9-10+lenny4.

The oldstable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.2.3-4+etch9.

For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems will be fixed in version 2.2.11-7.

This advisory also provides updated apache2-mpm-itk packages which
have been recompiled against the new apache2 packages.

Updated packages for the s390 and mipsel architectures are not
included yet. They will be released as soon as they become available.";
