tag_insight = "Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) provide a system whereby
  administrators can set up authentication policies without having to
  recompile programs that handle authentication.

  It was discovered that the pam_namespace module executed the external
  script namespace.init with an unchanged environment inherited from an
  application calling PAM. In cases where such an environment was untrusted
  (for example, when pam_namespace was configured for setuid applications
  such as su or sudo), a local, unprivileged user could possibly use this
  flaw to escalate their privileges. (CVE-2010-3853)
  
  It was discovered that the pam_mail module used root privileges while
  accessing users' files. In certain configurations, a local, unprivileged
  user could use this flaw to obtain limited information about files or
  directories that they do not have access to. (CVE-2010-3435)
  
  It was discovered that the pam_xauth module did not verify the return
  values of the setuid() and setgid() system calls. A local, unprivileged
  user could use this flaw to execute the xauth command with root privileges
  and make it read an arbitrary input file. (CVE-2010-3316)
  
  Red Hat would like to thank Sebastian Krahmer of the SuSE Security Team for
  reporting the CVE-2010-3435 issue.
  
  All pam users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to correct these issues.";
