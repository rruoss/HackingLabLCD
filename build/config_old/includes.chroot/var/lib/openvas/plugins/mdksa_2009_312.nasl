tag_insight = "A vulnerability has been found and corrected in ISC DHCP:

Integer overflow in the ISC dhcpd 3.0.x before 3.0.7 and 3.1.x before
3.1.1; and the DHCP server in EMC VMware Workstation before 5.5.5 Build
56455 and 6.x before 6.0.1 Build 55017, Player before 1.0.5 Build 56455
and Player 2 before 2.0.1 Build 55017, ACE before 1.0.3 Build 54075 and
ACE 2 before 2.0.1 Build 55017, and Server before 1.0.4 Build 56528;
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash)
or execute arbitrary code via a malformed DHCP packet with a large
dhcp-max-message-size that triggers a stack-based buffer overflow,
related to servers configured to send many DHCP options to clients
(CVE-2007-0062).

Stack-based buffer overflow in the script_write_params method in
client/dhclient.c in ISC DHCP dhclient 4.1 before 4.1.0p1, 4.0
before 4.0.1p1, 3.1 before 3.1.2p1, 3.0, and 2.0 allows remote DHCP
servers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted subnet-mask option
(CVE-2009-0692).

ISC DHCP Server is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by the
improper handling of DHCP requests. If the host definitions are mixed
using dhcp-client-identifier and hardware ethernet, a remote attacker
could send specially-crafted DHCP requests to cause the server to
stop responding (CVE-2009-1892).

Packages for 2008.0 are being provided due to extended support for
Corporate products.

This update provides fixes for this vulnerability.

Affected: 2008.0";
