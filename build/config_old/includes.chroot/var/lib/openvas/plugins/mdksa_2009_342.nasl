tag_insight = "Multiple vulnerabilities has been found and corrected in acpid:

A certain Red Hat patch for acpid 1.0.4 effectively triggers a call
to the open function with insufficient arguments, which might allow
local users to leverage weak permissions on /var/log/acpid, and obtain
sensitive information by reading this file, cause a denial of service
by overwriting this file, or gain privileges by executing this file
(CVE-2009-4033).

acpid 1.0.4 sets an unrestrictive umask, which might allow local users
to leverage weak permissions on /var/log/acpid, and obtain sensitive
information by reading this file or cause a denial of service by
overwriting this file, a different vulnerability than CVE-2009-4033
(CVE-2009-4235).

This update provides a solution to these vulnerabilities.
