tag_insight = "Several vulnerabilities have been found in vim, an enhanced vi editor.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:

CVE-2008-2712

Jan Minar discovered that vim did not properly sanitise inputs
before invoking the execute or system functions inside vim
scripts. This could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2008-3074

Jan Minar discovered that the tar plugin of vim did not properly
sanitise the filenames in the tar archive or the name of the
archive file itself, making it prone to arbitrary code execution.

CVE-2008-3075

Jan Minar discovered that the zip plugin of vim did not properly
sanitise the filenames in the zip archive or the name of the
archive file itself, making it prone to arbitrary code execution.

CVE-2008-3076

Jan Minar discovered that the netrw plugin of vim did not properly
sanitise the filenames or directory names it is given. This could
lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2008-4101

Ben Schmidt discovered that vim did not properly escape characters
when performing keyword or tag lookups. This could lead to the
execution of arbitrary code.


For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:7.1.314-3+lenny1, which was already included in the lenny
release.

For the oldstable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:7.0-122+1etch4.

For the testing distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 1:7.1.314-3+lenny1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:7.2.010-1.";
