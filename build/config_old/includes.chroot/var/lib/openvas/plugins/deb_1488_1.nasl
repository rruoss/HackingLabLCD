based bulletin board.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:

CVE-2008-0471

Private messaging allowed cross site request forgery, making
it possible to delete all private messages of a user by sending
them to a crafted web page.

CVE-2006-6841 / CVE-2006-6508

Cross site request forgery enabled an attacker to perform various
actions on behalf of a logged in user. (Applies to sarge only)

CVE-2006-6840

A negative start parameter could allow an attacker to create
invalid output. (Applies to sarge only)

CVE-2006-6839

unauthorised external redirections via a phpBB forum.
(Applies to sarge only)

CVE-2006-4758
