tag_insight = "Multiple vulnerabilities was discovered and corrected in ruby:

ext/openssl/ossl_ocsp.c in Ruby 1.8 and 1.9 does not properly check
the return value from the OCSP_basic_verify function, which might allow
remote attackers to successfully present an invalid X.509 certificate,
possibly involving a revoked certificate (CVE-2009-0642).

The BigDecimal library in Ruby 1.8.6 before p369 and 1.8.7 before
p173 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service
(application crash) via a string argument that represents a large
number, as demonstrated by an attempted conversion to the Float data
type (CVE-2009-1904).

Packages for 2008.0 are being provided due to extended support for
Corporate products.

This update provides a solution to these vulnerabilities.

Affected: 2008.0";

of md5 checksums and GPG signatures is performed automatically for you.
