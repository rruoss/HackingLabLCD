tag_insight = "An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel when inotify is used
  to monitor the /dev/ptmx device. A local user could exploit this flaw to
  discover keystroke timing and potentially discover sensitive information
  like password length. (CVE-2013-0160)

  A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's perf events subsystem for Intel
  Sandy Bridge and Ivy Bridge processors. A local user could exploit this
  flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2013-2146)

  An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's crypto API. A
  local user could exploit this flaw to examine potentially sensitive
  information from the kernel's stack memory. (CVE-2013-3076)

  An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's rcvmsg path for
  ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode). A local user could exploit this flaw to
  examine potentially sensitive information from the kernel's stack memory.
  (CVE-2013-3222)

  An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's recvmsg path for
  ax25 address family. A local user could exploit this flaw to examine
  potentially sensitive information from the kernel's stack memory.
  (CVE-2013-3223)

  An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's recvmsg path for
  the bluetooth address family. A local user could exploit this flaw to
  examine potentially sensitive information from the kernel's stack memory.
  (CVE-2013-3224)

  An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's bluetooth rfcomm
  protocol support. A local user could exploit this flaw to examine
  potentially sensitive information from the kernel's stack memory.
  (CVE-2013-3225)

  An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's CAIF protocol
  implementation. A local user could exploit this flaw to examine potentially
  sensitive information from the kernel's stack memory. (CVE-2013-3227)

  An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's IRDA (infrared)
  support subsystem. A local user could exploit this flaw to examine
  potentially sensitive information from the kernel's stack memory.
  (CVE-2013-3228)

  An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's s390 - z/VM
  support. A local user could exploit this flaw to examine potentially
  sensitive information from the kernel's stack memory. (CVE-2013-3229)

  An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's llc (Logical Link
  Layer 2) support. A local user could exploit this flaw to examine
  potentially sensitive information from the kernel's stack memory.
  (CVE-2013-3231)

  An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's receiv ...
