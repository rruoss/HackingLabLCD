advisory RHSA-2009:0339.

Little Color Management System (LittleCMS, or simply lcms) is a
small-footprint, speed-optimized open source color management engine.

Multiple integer overflow flaws which could lead to heap-based buffer
overflows, as well as multiple insufficient input validation flaws, were
found in LittleCMS. An attacker could use these flaws to create a
specially-crafted image file which could cause an application using
LittleCMS to crash, or, possibly, execute arbitrary code when opened by a
victim. (CVE-2009-0723, CVE-2009-0733)

A memory leak flaw was found in LittleCMS. An application using LittleCMS
could use excessive amount of memory, and possibly crash after using all
available memory, if used to open specially-crafted images. (CVE-2009-0581)

Red Hat would like to thank Chris Evans from the Google Security Team for
reporting these issues.

All users of LittleCMS should install these updated packages, which upgrade
LittleCMS to version 1.18. All running applications using the lcms library
must be restarted for the update to take effect.";
