advisory RHSA-2009:0336.

GLib is the low-level core library that forms the basis for projects such
as GTK+ and GNOME. It provides data structure handling for C, portability
wrappers, and interfaces for such runtime functionality as an event loop,
threads, dynamic loading, and an object system.

Diego Pettenò discovered multiple integer overflows causing heap-based
buffer overflows in GLib's Base64 encoding and decoding functions. An
attacker could use these flaws to crash an application using GLib's Base64
functions to encode or decode large, untrusted inputs, or, possibly,
execute arbitrary code as the user running the application. (CVE-2008-4316)

Note: No application shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 uses the
affected functions. Third-party applications may, however, be affected.

All users of glib2 should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
backported patches to resolve these issues.";
