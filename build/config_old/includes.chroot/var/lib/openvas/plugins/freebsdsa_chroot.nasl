tag_insight = "Chroot is an operation that changes the apparent root directory for the
current process and its children.  The chroot(2) system call is widely
used in many applications as a measure of limiting a process's access to
the file system, as part of implementing privilege separation.

The nsdispatch(3) API implementation has a feature to reload its
configuration on demand.  This feature may also load shared libraries
and run code provided by the library when requested by the configuration
file.

The nsdispatch(3) API has no mechanism to alert it to whether it is
operating within a chroot environment in which the standard paths for
configuration files and shared libraries may be untrustworthy.

The FreeBSD ftpd(8) daemon can be configured to use chroot(2), and
also uses the nsdispatch(3) API.";
