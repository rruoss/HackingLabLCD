traversal vulnerability in chrome: URI handling could lead to
information disclosure.

CVE-2008-0419

David Bloom discovered a race condition in the image handling of
designMode elements, which can lead to information disclosure or
potentially the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2008-0591

Michal Zalewski discovered that timers protecting security-sensitive
dialogs (which disable dialog elements until a timeout is reached)
could be bypassed by window focus changes through Javascript.

CVE-2008-0592
