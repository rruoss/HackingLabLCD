tag_insight = "A vulnerability has been found and corrected in wget:

GNU Wget before 1.12 does not properly handle a '\0' (NUL) character
in a domain name in the Common Name field of an X.509 certificate,
which allows man-in-the-middle remote attackers to spoof arbitrary SSL
servers via a crafted certificate issued by a legitimate Certification
Authority, a related issue to CVE-2009-2408 (CVE-2009-3490).

This update provides a solution to this vulnerability.

Packages for 2008.0 are being provided due to extended support for
Corporate products.
