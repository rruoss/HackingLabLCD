CVE-2007-6438
Unspecified vulnerability in the SMB dissector in Wireshark (formerly
Ethereal) 0.99.6 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
via unknown vectors.  NOTE: this identifier originally included MP3
and NCP, but those issues are already covered by CVE-2007-6111.

CVE-2007-6439
Wireshark (formerly Ethereal) 0.99.6 allows remote attackers to cause
a denial of service (infinite or large loop) via the (1) IPv6 or (2)
USB dissector, which can trigger resource consumption or a crash.
NOTE: this identifier originally included Firebird/Interbase, but it
is already covered by CVE-2007-6116.  The DCP ETSI issue is already
covered by CVE-2007-6119.

CVE-2007-6441
The WiMAX dissector in Wireshark (formerly Ethereal) 0.99.6 allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via unknown
vectors related to 'unaligned access on some platforms.'

CVE-2007-6450
The RPL dissector in Wireshark (formerly Ethereal) 0.9.8 to 0.99.6
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop)
via unknown vectors.

CVE-2007-6451
Unspecified vulnerability in the CIP dissector in Wireshark (formerly
Ethereal) 0.9.14 to 0.99.6 allows remote attackers to cause a denial
of service (crash) via unknown vectors that trigger allocation of
large amounts of memory.";
