tag_insight = "A security vulnerability has been identified and fixed in nfs-utils,
which caused TCP Wrappers to ignore netgroups and allows remote
attackers to bypass intended access restrictions (CVE-2008-4552).

The updated packages have been patched to prevent this.

Update:

The Corporate Server 4 packages had the wrong release number (lower
than before) which prevented the update packages from being installed
automatically. This problem has now been solved with new packages
with the correct release number.

Affected: Corporate 4.0";

of md5 checksums and GPG signatures is performed automatically for you.
