tag_summary = "The remote host is missing updates announced in
advisory RHSA-2009:0010.

Ivan Markovic discovered a cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw in SquirrelMail
caused by insufficient HTML mail sanitization. A remote attacker could send
a specially-crafted HTML mail or attachment that could cause a user's Web
browser to execute a malicious script in the context of the SquirrelMail
session when that email or attachment was opened by the user.
(CVE-2008-2379)

It was discovered that SquirrelMail allowed cookies over insecure
connections (ie did not restrict cookies to HTTPS connections). An attacker
who controlled the communication channel between a user and the
SquirrelMail server, or who was able to sniff the user's network
communication, could use this flaw to obtain the user's session cookie, if
a user made an HTTP request to the server. (CVE-2008-3663)

Note: After applying this update, all session cookies set for SquirrelMail
sessions started over HTTPS connections will have the secure flag set.
That is, browsers will only send such cookies over an HTTPS connection. If
needed, you can revert to the previous behavior by setting the
configuration option $only_secure_cookies to false in SquirrelMail's
/etc/squirrelmail/config.php configuration file.

Users of squirrelmail should upgrade to this updated package, which
contains backported patches to correct these issues.";
