  A heap overflow flaw was found in the EMF parser. An attacker could create
  a carefully crafted EMF file that could cause OpenOffice.org to crash or
  possibly execute arbitrary code if the malicious EMF image was added to a
  document or if a document containing the malicious EMF file was opened by a
  victim. (CVE-2007-5746)
  
  A heap overflow flaw was found in the OLE Structured Storage file parser.
  (OLE Structured Storage is a format used by Microsoft Office documents.) An
  attacker could create a carefully crafted OLE file that could cause
  OpenOffice.org to crash or possibly execute arbitrary code if the file was
  opened by a victim. (CVE-2008-0320)

  packages, which contain backported fixes to correct these issues.";
