tag_insight = "Changes in DSA-1719-1 caused GNUTLS to reject X.509v1 certificates as
CA root certificates by default, as originally described in the
documentation.  However, it turned out that there is still significant
use of historic X.509v1 CA root certificates, so this constitutes an
unacceptable regression.  This update reverses this part of the
changes in DSA-1719-1.  Note that the X.509v1 certificate format does
not distinguish between server and CA certificates, which means that
an X.509v1 server certificates is implicitly converted into a CA
certificate when added to the trust store (which was the reason for
the change in DSA-1719-1).

The current stable distribution (lenny) was released with the changes
in DSA-1719-1 already applied, and this update reverses the changes
concerning X.509v1 CA certificates for this distribution, too.

For the old stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.4-3+etch4.

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.2-6+lenny1.

We recommend that you upgrade your GNUTLS packages.";
