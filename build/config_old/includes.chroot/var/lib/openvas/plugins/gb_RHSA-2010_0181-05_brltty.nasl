tag_insight = "brltty (Braille TTY) is a background process (daemon) which provides access
  to the Linux console (when in text mode) for a blind person using a
  refreshable braille display. It drives the braille display, and provides
  complete screen review functionality.

  It was discovered that a brltty library had an insecure relative RPATH
  (runtime library search path) set in the ELF (Executable and Linking
  Format) header. A local user able to convince another user to run an
  application using brltty in an attacker-controlled directory, could run
  arbitrary code with the privileges of the victim. (CVE-2008-3279)
  
  These updated packages also provide fixes for the following bugs:
  
  * the brltty configuration file is documented in the brltty manual page,
  but there is no separate manual page for the /etc/brltty.conf configuration
  file: running &quot;man brltty.conf&quot; returned &quot;No manual entry for brltty.conf&quot;
  rather than opening the brltty manual entry. This update adds brltty.conf.5
  as an alias to the brltty manual page. Consequently, running &quot;man
  brltty.conf&quot; now opens the manual entry documenting the brltty.conf
  specification. (BZ#530554)
  
  * previously, the brltty-pm.conf configuration file was installed in the
  /etc/brltty/ directory. This file, which configures Papenmeier Braille
  Terminals for use with Red Hat Enterprise Linux, is optional. As well, it
  did not come with a corresponding manual page. With this update, the file
  has been moved to /usr/share/doc/brltty-3.7.2/BrailleDrivers/Papenmeier/.
  This directory also includes a README document that explains the file's
  purpose and format. (BZ#530554)
  
  * during the brltty packages installation, the message
  
  Creating screen inspection device /dev/vcsa...done.
  
  was presented at the console. This was inadequate, especially during the
  initial install of the system. These updated packages do not send any
  message to the console during installation. (BZ#529163)
  
  * although brltty contains ELF objects, the brltty-debuginfo package was
  empty. With this update, the -debuginfo package contains valid debugging
  information as expected. (BZ#500545)
  
  * the MAX_NR_CONSOLES definition was acquired by brltty by #including
  linux/tty.h in Programs/api_client.c. MAX_NR_CONSOLES has since moved to
  linux/vt.h but the #include in api_client.c was not updated. Consequently,
  brltty could not be built from the source RPM against the Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 5 kernel. This update corrects the #include in
  api_client.c to linux/vt.h and brltty now builds from source as expected.
  (BZ#456247)
  
  All brltty users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  resolve these issues.";
