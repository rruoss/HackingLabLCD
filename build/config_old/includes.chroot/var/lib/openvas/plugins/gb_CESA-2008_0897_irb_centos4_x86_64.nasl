  The Ruby DNS resolver library, resolv.rb, used predictable transaction IDs
  and a fixed source port when sending DNS requests. A remote attacker could
  use this flaw to spoof a malicious reply to a DNS query. (CVE-2008-3905)
  
  Ruby's XML document parsing module (REXML) was prone to a denial of service
  attack via XML documents with large XML entity definitions recursion. A
  specially-crafted XML file could cause a Ruby application using the REXML
  module to use an excessive amount of CPU and memory. (CVE-2008-3790)
  
  An insufficient &quot;taintness&quot; check flaw was discovered in Ruby's DL module,
  which provides direct access to the C language functions. An attacker could
  use this flaw to bypass intended safe-level restrictions by calling
  external C functions with the arguments from an untrusted tainted inputs.
  (CVE-2008-3657)
  
  A denial of service flaw was discovered in WEBrick, Ruby's HTTP server
  toolkit. A remote attacker could send a specially-crafted HTTP request to a
  WEBrick server that would cause the server to use an excessive amount of
  CPU time. (CVE-2008-3656)
  
  A number of flaws were found in the safe-level restrictions in Ruby. It
  was possible for an attacker to create a carefully crafted malicious script
  that can allow the bypass of certain safe-level restrictions. (CVE-2008-3655)
  
  A denial of service flaw was found in Ruby's regular expression engine. If
  a Ruby script tried to process a large amount of data via a regular
  expression, it could cause Ruby to enter an infinite-loop and crash.
  (CVE-2008-3443)
  
  Users of ruby should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to resolve these issues.";
