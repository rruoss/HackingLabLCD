Problem Description

a. VMware Host Checkpoint file memory corruption

Input data is not properly validated when loading Checkpoint files. This may
allow an attacker with the ability to load a specially crafted Checkpoint file
to execute arbitrary code on the host.

VMware would like to thank Thorsten Tüllmann for reporting this issue to us.

Workaround - None identified

Mitigation - Do not import virtual machines from untrusted sources.

b. VMware Virtual Machine Remote Device Denial of Service

A device (e.g. CD-ROM, keyboard) that is available to a virtual machine while
physically connected to a system that does not run the virtual machine is
referred to as a remote device.

Traffic coming from remote virtual devices is incorrectly handled. This may
allow an attacker who is capable of manipulating the traffic from a remote
virtual device to crash the virtual machine.

Workaround - None identified

Mitigation - Users need administrative privileges on the virtual machine in
order to attach remote devices. - Do not attach untrusted remote devices to a
virtual machine.

Solution
Apply the missing patch(es).";
