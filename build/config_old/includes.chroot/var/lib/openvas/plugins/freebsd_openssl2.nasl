CVE-2006-2937
OpenSSL 0.9.7 before 0.9.7l and 0.9.8 before 0.9.8d allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop and memory
consumption) via malformed ASN.1 structures that trigger an improperly
handled error condition.
CVE-2006-2938
** RESERVED **
This candidate has been reserved by an organization or individual that
will use it when announcing a new security problem.  When the
candidate has been publicized, the details for this candidate will be
provided.
CVE-2006-2940
OpenSSL 0.9.7 before 0.9.7l, 0.9.8 before 0.9.8d, and earlier versions
allows attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via
parasitic public keys with large (1) 'public exponent' or (2) 'public
modulus' values in X.509 certificates that require extra time to
process when using RSA signature verification.
CVE-2006-3738
Buffer overflow in the SSL_get_shared_ciphers function in OpenSSL
0.9.7 before 0.9.7l, 0.9.8 before 0.9.8d, and earlier versions has
unspecified impact and remote attack vectors involving a long list of
ciphers.
CVE-2006-4343
The get_server_hello function in the SSLv2 client code in OpenSSL
0.9.7 before 0.9.7l, 0.9.8 before 0.9.8d, and earlier versions allows
remote servers to cause a denial of service (client crash) via unknown
vectors that trigger a null pointer dereference.";
