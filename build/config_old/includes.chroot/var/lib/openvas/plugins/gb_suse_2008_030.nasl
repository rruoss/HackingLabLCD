tag_insight = "The Linux kernel update was updated on openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3 to fix
  the following security problems:

  CVE-2008-2136: A problem in SIT IPv6 tunnel handling could be used
  by remote attackers to immediately crash the machine.

  CVE-2007-6282: A remote attacker could crash the IPSec/IPv6 stack
  by sending a bad ESP packet. This requires the host to be able to
  receive such packets (default filtered by the firewall).

  CVE-2007-5904: A remote buffer overflow in CIFS was fixed which
  could potentially be used by remote attackers to crash the machine
  or potentially execute code.

  CVE-2008-1615: On x86_64 a denial of service attack could be used by
  local attackers to immediately panic / crash the machine.

  CVE-2008-2358: A security problem in DCCP was fixed, which could be
  used by remote attackers to crash the machine. Only a fix for openSUSE
  10.2 was necessary.

  CVE-2008-2148: The permission checking in sys_utimensat was incorrect
  and local attackers could change the file times of files they do not
  own to the current time.

  CVE-2007-6206: An information leakage during core dumping of root
  processes was fixed. This problem was already fixed for openSUSE 10.3
  previously and was now fixed for openSUSE 10.2.

  CVE-2007-6712: A integer overflow in the hrtimer_forward function
  (hrtimer.c) in Linux kernel, when running on 64-bit systems, allows
  local users to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via a timer
  with a large expiry value, which causes the timer to always be expired.

  CVE-2008-1669: Fixed a SMP ordering problem in fcntl_setlk could
  potentially allow local attackers to execute code by timing file
  locking.

  CVE-2008-1367: Clear the &quot;direction&quot; flag before calling signal
  handlers. For specific not yet identified programs under specific
  timing conditions this could potentially have caused memory corruption
  or code execution.

  CVE-2008-1375: Fixed a dnotify race condition, which could be used
  by local attackers to potentially execute code.

  CVE-2007-5500: A ptrace bug could be used by local attackers to hang
  their own processes indefinitely.

  Also various non security bugs were fixed, please see the RPM changelogs.";
