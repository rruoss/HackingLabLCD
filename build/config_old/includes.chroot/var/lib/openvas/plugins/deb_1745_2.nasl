tag_insight = "This update fixes a possible regression introduced in DSA-1745-1 and
also enhances the security patch. For reference the original advisory
text is below.

Several security issues have been discovered in lcms, a color management
library. The Common Vulnerabilities andi Exposures project identifies
the following problems:

CVE-2009-0581

Chris Evans discovered that lcms is affected by a memory leak, which
could result in a denial of service via specially crafted image files.

CVE-2009-0723

Chris Evans discovered that lcms is prone to several integer overflows
via specially crafted image files, which could lead to the execution of
arbitrary code.

CVE-2009-0733

Chris Evans discovered the lack of upper-gounds check on sizes leading
to a buffer overflow, which could be used to execute arbitrary code.


For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.17.dfsg-1+lenny2.

For the oldstable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.15-1.1+etch3.

For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your lcms packages.";
