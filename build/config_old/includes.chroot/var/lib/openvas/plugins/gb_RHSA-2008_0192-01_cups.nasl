tag_insight = "The Common UNIX Printing System (CUPS) provides a portable printing layer
  for UNIX(R) operating systems.

  A heap buffer overflow flaw was found in a CUPS administration interface
  CGI script. A local attacker able to connect to the IPP port (TCP port 631)
  could send a malicious request causing the script to crash or, potentially,
  execute arbitrary code as the &quot;lp&quot; user. Please note: the default CUPS
  configuration in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 does not allow remote
  connections to the IPP TCP port. (CVE-2008-0047)
  
  Red Hat would like to thank &quot;regenrecht&quot; for reporting this issue.
  
  This issue did not affect the versions of CUPS as shipped with Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 3 or 4.
  
  Two overflows were discovered in the HP-GL/2-to-PostScript filter. An
  attacker could create a malicious HP-GL/2 file that could possibly execute
  arbitrary code as the &quot;lp&quot; user if the file is printed. (CVE-2008-0053)
  
  A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the GIF decoding routines used by
  CUPS image converting filters &quot;imagetops&quot; and &quot;imagetoraster&quot;. An attacker
  could create a malicious GIF file that could possibly execute arbitrary
  code as the &quot;lp&quot; user if the file was printed. (CVE-2008-1373)
  
  All cups users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to resolve these issues.";
