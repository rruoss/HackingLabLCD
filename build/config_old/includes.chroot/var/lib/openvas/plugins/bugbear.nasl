A cracker may connect to it to retrieve secret

The BugBear worm includes a key logger and can kill 
antivirus or personal firewall softwares. It propagates 
itself through email and open Windows shares.
Depending on the antivirus vendor, it is known as: Tanatos, 
I-Worm.Tanatos, NATOSTA.A, W32/Bugbear-A, Tanatos, W32/Bugbear@MM, 
WORM_BUGBEAR.A, Win32.BugBear...

# There was no information on the BugBear protocol. 
# I found a worm in the wild and found that it replied to the "p" command;
# the data look random but ends with "ID:"  and a number
# Thomas Reinke confirmed that his specimen of the worm behaved in the 
# same way. 
# We will not provide the full data here because it might contain 
# confidential information.
