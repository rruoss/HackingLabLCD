tag_insight = "Dovecot is an IMAP server for Linux and UNIX-like systems, primarily
  written with security in mind.

  A flaw was discovered in the way Dovecot handled the &quot;mail_extra_groups&quot;
  option. An authenticated attacker with local shell access could leverage
  this flaw to read, modify, or delete other users mail that is stored on
  the mail server. (CVE-2008-1199)
  
  This issue did not affect the default Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 Dovecot
  configuration. This update adds two new configuration options --
  &quot;mail_privileged_group&quot; and &quot;mail_access_groups&quot; -- to minimize the usage
  of additional privileges.
  
  A directory traversal flaw was discovered in Dovecot's zlib plug-in. An
  authenticated user could use this flaw to view other compressed mailboxes
  with the permissions of the Dovecot process. (CVE-2007-2231)
  
  A flaw was found in the Dovecot ACL plug-in. User with only insert
  permissions for a mailbox could use the &quot;COPY&quot; and &quot;APPEND&quot; commands to set
  additional message flags. (CVE-2007-4211)
  
  A flaw was found in a way Dovecot cached LDAP query results in certain
  configurations. This could possibly allow authenticated users to log in as
  a different user who has the same password. (CVE-2007-6598)
  
  As well, this updated package fixes the following bugs:
  
  * configuring &quot;userdb&quot; and &quot;passdb&quot; to use LDAP caused Dovecot to hang. A
  segmentation fault may have occurred. In this updated package, using an
  LDAP backend for &quot;userdb&quot; and &quot;passdb&quot; no longer causes Dovecot to hang.
  
  * the Dovecot &quot;login_process_size&quot; limit was configured for 32-bit systems.
  On 64-bit systems, when Dovecot was configured to use either IMAP or POP3,
  the log in processes crashed with out-of-memory errors. Errors such as the
  following were logged:
  
  pop3-login: pop3-login: error while loading shared libraries:
  libsepol.so.1: failed to map segment from shared object: Cannot allocate
  memory
  
  In this updated package, the &quot;login_process_size&quot; limit is correctly
  configured on 64-bit systems, which resolves this issue.
  
  Note: this updated package upgrades dovecot to version 1.0.7. For
  further details, refer to the Dovecot changelog:

  Users of dovecot are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
  resolves these issues.";
