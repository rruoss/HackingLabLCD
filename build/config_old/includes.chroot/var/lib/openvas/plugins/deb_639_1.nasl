tag_insight = "Andrew V. Samoilov has noticed that several bugfixes which were
applied to the source by upstream developers of mc, the midnight
commander, a file browser and manager, were not backported to the
current version of mc that Debian ships in their stable release.  The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project identifies the following
vulnerabilities:

CVE-2004-1004: Multiple format string vulnerabilities
CVE-2004-1005: Multiple buffer overflows
CVE-2004-1009: One infinite loop vulnerability
CVE-2004-1090: Denial of service via  corrupted section header
CVE-2004-1091: Denial of service via null dereference
CVE-2004-1092: Freeing unallocated memory
CVE-2004-1093: Denial of service via use of already freed memory
CVE-2004-1174: Denial of service via manipulating non-existing file handles
CVE-2004-1175: Unintended program execution via insecure filename quoting
CVE-2004-1176: Denial of service via a buffer underflow

For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 4.5.55-1.2woody5

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems should already be
fixed since they were backported from current versions.
