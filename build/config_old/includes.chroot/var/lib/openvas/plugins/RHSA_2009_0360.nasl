tag_summary = "The remote host is missing updates announced in
advisory RHSA-2009:0360.

The kernel-rt packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

These updated packages address the following security issues:

* a memory leak exists in keyctl handling. A local, unprivileged user could
use this flaw to deplete kernel memory, eventually leading to a denial of
service. (CVE-2009-0031, Important)

* an off-by-one underflow flaw was found in the eCryptfs subsystem. This
could potentially cause a denial of service when the readlink() function
returned an error. (CVE-2009-0269, Moderate)

* a deficiency was found in the Remote BIOS Update (RBU) driver for Dell
systems. This could allow a local, unprivileged user to cause a denial of
service by reading zero bytes from the image_type or packet_size files in
/sys/devices/platform/dell_rbu/. (CVE-2009-0322, Moderate)

* an inverted logic flaw was found in the SysKonnect FDDI PCI adapter
driver, allowing driver statistics to be reset only when the CAP_NET_ADMIN
capability was absent (local, unprivileged users could reset driver
statistics). (CVE-2009-0675, Moderate)

* the sock_getsockopt() function in the Linux kernel did not properly
initialize a data structure that can be directly returned to user-space
when the getsockopt() function is called with SO_BSDCOMPAT optname set.
This flaw could possibly lead to memory disclosure.
(CVE-2009-0676, Moderate)

advisories.

All Red Hat Enterprise MRG users should install this update which addresses
these vulnerabilities and fixes these bugs. For this update to take effect,
the system must be rebooted.";
