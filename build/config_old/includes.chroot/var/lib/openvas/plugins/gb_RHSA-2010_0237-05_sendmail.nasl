tag_insight = "Sendmail is a very widely used Mail Transport Agent (MTA). MTAs deliver
  mail from one machine to another. Sendmail is not a client program, but
  rather a behind-the-scenes daemon that moves email over networks or the
  Internet to its final destination.

  The configuration of sendmail in Red Hat Enterprise Linux was found to not
  reject the &quot;localhost.localdomain&quot; domain name for email messages that come
  from external hosts. This could allow remote attackers to disguise spoofed
  messages. (CVE-2006-7176)
  
  A flaw was found in the way sendmail handled NUL characters in the
  CommonName field of X.509 certificates. An attacker able to get a
  carefully-crafted certificate signed by a trusted Certificate Authority
  could trick sendmail into accepting it by mistake, allowing the attacker to
  perform a man-in-the-middle attack or bypass intended client certificate
  authentication. (CVE-2009-4565)
  
  Note: The CVE-2009-4565 issue only affected configurations using TLS with
  certificate verification and CommonName checking enabled, which is not a
  typical configuration.
  
  This update also fixes the following bugs:
  
  * sendmail was unable to parse files specified by the ServiceSwitchFile
  option which used a colon as a separator. (BZ#512871)
  
  * sendmail incorrectly returned a zero exit code when free space was low.
  (BZ#299951)
  
  * the sendmail manual page had a blank space between the -qG option and
  parameter. (BZ#250552)
  
  * the comments in the sendmail.mc file specified the wrong path to SSL
  certificates. (BZ#244012)
  
  * the sendmail packages did not provide the MTA capability. (BZ#494408)
  
  All users of sendmail are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which resolve these issues.";
