tag_summary = "Cfengine is running on this remote host.

This version is prone to a stack-based buffer overrun vulnerability. 
An attacker, exploiting this flaw, would need network access to the
server as well as the ability to send a crafted transaction packet
to the cfservd process.  A successful exploitation of this flaw
would lead to arbitrary code being executed on the remote machine
or a loss of service (DoS).";

tag_solution = "Upgrade to at least 1.5.3-4, 2.0.8 or most recent 2.1 version.";
