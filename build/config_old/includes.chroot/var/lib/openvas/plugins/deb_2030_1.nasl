builder is not properly escaping input when generating a unique username
based on a remote user name from a single sign-on application.  An attacker
can use this to compromise the mahara database via crafted user names.

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.4-4+lenny5.

For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.4-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your mahara packages.";
