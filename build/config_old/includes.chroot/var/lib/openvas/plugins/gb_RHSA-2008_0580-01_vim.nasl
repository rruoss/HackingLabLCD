tag_insight = "Vim (Visual editor IMproved) is an updated and improved version of the vi
  editor.

  Several input sanitization flaws were found in Vim's keyword and tag
  handling. If Vim looked up a document's maliciously crafted tag or keyword,
  it was possible to execute arbitrary code as the user running Vim.
  (CVE-2008-4101)
  
  Multiple security flaws were found in netrw.vim, the Vim plug-in providing
  file reading and writing over the network. If a user opened a specially
  crafted file or directory with the netrw plug-in, it could result in
  arbitrary code execution as the user running Vim. (CVE-2008-3076)
  
  A security flaw was found in zip.vim, the Vim plug-in that handles ZIP
  archive browsing. If a user opened a ZIP archive using the zip.vim plug-in,
  it could result in arbitrary code execution as the user running Vim.
  (CVE-2008-3075)
  
  A security flaw was found in tar.vim, the Vim plug-in which handles TAR
  archive browsing. If a user opened a TAR archive using the tar.vim plug-in,
  it could result in arbitrary code execution as the user runnin Vim.
  (CVE-2008-3074)
  
  Several input sanitization flaws were found in various Vim system
  functions. If a user opened a specially crafted file, it was possible to
  execute arbitrary code as the user running Vim. (CVE-2008-2712)
  
  Ulf Härnhammar, of Secunia Research, discovered a format string flaw in
  Vim's help tag processor. If a user was tricked into executing the
  &quot;helptags&quot; command on malicious data, arbitrary code could be executed with
  the permissions of the user running Vim. (CVE-2007-2953)
  
  All Vim users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues.";
