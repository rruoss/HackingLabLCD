# Description: Web Server Cross Site Scripting
#
# Authors:
# SecuriTeam (code was the "40x_cross_site.nasl")
# modified by CIRT.net (sq@cirt.net) (with help from SecuriTeam) to check
# for multiple cross site scripting vuls.
# Update by Felix Huber - huberfelix@webtopia.de - 14.11.2001
# Update by Chris Sullo - sq@cirt.net - 16.11.2001
# false positive fix by Andrew Hintz - http://guh.nu - 1.3.2002
# Update by rd: thanks to Andrew's remarks, HTTP headers are discared
# Update by Chris Sullo - sq@cirt.net - 06/27/2002 -- added .cfm test

tag_summary = "The remote web server seems to be vulnerable to a Cross Site Scripting
vulnerability (XSS). The vulnerability is caused by the result being
returned to the user when a non-existing file is requested (e.g. the
result contains script code provided in the request).

This vulnerability would allow an attacker to make the server present the
user with the attacker's JavaScript/HTML code.
Since the content is presented by the server, the user will give it the trust
level of the server (for example, the websites banks, shopping centers,
etc. would usually be trusted by a user).
