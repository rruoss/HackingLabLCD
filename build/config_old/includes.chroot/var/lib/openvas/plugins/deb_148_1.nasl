tag_insight = "A set of problems have been discovered in Hylafax, a flexible
client/server fax software distributed with many GNU/Linux
distributions.  Quoting SecurityFocus the problems are in detail:

* A format string vulnerability makes it possible for users to
potentially execute arbitrary code on some implementations.  Due to
insufficient checking of input, it's possible to execute a format
string attack.  Since this only affects systems with the faxrm and
faxalter programs installed setuid, Debian is not vulnerable.

* A buffer overflow has been reported in Hylafax.  A malicious fax
transmission may include a long scan line that will overflow a
memory buffer, corrupting adjacent memory.  An exploid may result
in a denial of service condition, or possibly the execution of
arbitrary code with root privileges.

* A format string vulnerability has been discovered in faxgetty.
Incoming fax messages include a Transmitting Subscriber
Identification (TSI) string, used to identify the sending fax
machine.  Hylafax uses this data as part of a format string without
properly sanitizing the input.  Malicious fax data may cause the
server to crash, resulting in a denial of service condition.

* Marcin Dawcewicz discovered a format string vulnerability in hfaxd,
which will crash hfaxd under certain circumstances.  Since Debian
doesn't have hfaxd installed setuid root, this problem can not
directly lead into a vulnerability.  This has been fixed by Darren
Nickerson, which was already present in newer versions, but not in
the potato version.

These problems have been fixed in version 4.0.2-14.3 for the old
stable distribution (potato), in version 4.1.1-1.1 for the current
stable distribution (woody) and in version 4.1.2-2.1 for the unstable
distribution (sid).

We recommend that you upgrade your hylafax packages.";
