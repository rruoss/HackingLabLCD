tag_summary = "The remote host is missing updates to the kernel announced in
advisory RHSA-2009:0326.

Security fixes:

* memory leaks were found on some error paths in the icmp_send()
function in the Linux kernel. This could, potentially, cause the network
connectivity to cease. (CVE-2009-0778, Important)

* Chris Evans reported a deficiency in the clone() system call when called
with the CLONE_PARENT flag. This flaw permits the caller (the parent
process) to indicate an arbitrary signal it wants to receive when its child
process exits. This could lead to a denial of service of the parent
process. (CVE-2009-0028, Moderate)

* an off-by-one underflow flaw was found in the eCryptfs subsystem. This
could potentially cause a local denial of service when the readlink()
function returned an error. (CVE-2009-0269, Moderate)

* a deficiency was found in the Remote BIOS Update (RBU) driver for Dell
systems. This could allow a local, unprivileged user to cause a denial of
service by reading zero bytes from the image_type or packet_size files in
/sys/devices/platform/dell_rbu/. (CVE-2009-0322, Moderate)

* an inverted logic flaw was found in the SysKonnect FDDI PCI adapter
driver, allowing driver statistics to be reset only when the CAP_NET_ADMIN
capability was absent (local, unprivileged users could reset driver
statistics). (CVE-2009-0675, Moderate)

* the sock_getsockopt() function in the Linux kernel did not properly
initialize a data structure that can be directly returned to user-space
when the getsockopt() function is called with SO_BSDCOMPAT optname set.
This flaw could possibly lead to memory disclosure.
(CVE-2009-0676, Moderate)

* the ext2 and ext3 file system code failed to properly handle corrupted
data structures, leading to a possible local denial of service when read
or write operations were performed on a specially-crafted file system.
(CVE-2008-3528, Low)

* a deficiency was found in the libATA implementation. This could,
potentially, lead to a local denial of service. Note: by default, the
/dev/sg* devices are accessible only to the root user.
(CVE-2008-5700, Low)

All users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
backported patches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for
this update to take effect.";
