  Several flaws were found in the way Firefox processed certain malformed web
  content. A webpage containing malicious content could cause Firefox to
  crash, or potentially execute arbitrary code as the user running Firefox.
  (CVE-2008-0412, CVE-2008-0413, CVE-2008-0415, CVE-2008-0419)
  
  Several flaws were found in the way Firefox displayed malformed web
  content. A webpage containing specially-crafted content could trick a user
  into surrendering sensitive information. (CVE-2008-0591, CVE-2008-0593)
  
  A flaw was found in the way Firefox stored password data. If a user saves
  login information for a malicious website, it could be possible to corrupt
  the password database, preventing the user from properly accessing saved
  password data. (CVE-2008-0417)
  
  A flaw was found in the way Firefox handles certain chrome URLs. If a user
  has certain extensions installed, it could allow a malicious website to
  steal sensitive session data. Note: this flaw does not affect a default
  installation of Firefox. (CVE-2008-0418)
  
  A flaw was found in the way Firefox saves certain text files. If a
  website offers a file of type &quot;plain/text&quot;, rather than &quot;text/plain&quot;,
  Firefox will not show future &quot;text/plain&quot; content to the user in the
  browser, forcing them to save those files locally to view the content.
  (CVE-2008-0592) 
  
  Users of firefox are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to resolve these issues.";
