tag_insight = "PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language commonly used with the Apache
  HTTP Web server.

  Multiple missing input sanitization flaws were discovered in PHP's exif
  extension. A specially-crafted image file could cause the PHP interpreter
  to crash or, possibly, disclose portions of its memory when a PHP script
  tried to extract Exchangeable image file format (Exif) metadata from the
  image file. (CVE-2009-2687, CVE-2009-3292)
  
  A missing input sanitization flaw, leading to a buffer overflow, was
  discovered in PHP's gd library. A specially-crafted GD image file could
  cause the PHP interpreter to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code
  when opened. (CVE-2009-3546)
  
  It was discovered that PHP did not limit the maximum number of files that
  can be uploaded in one request. A remote attacker could use this flaw to
  instigate a denial of service by causing the PHP interpreter to use lots of
  system resources dealing with requests containing large amounts of files to
  be uploaded. This vulnerability depends on file uploads being enabled
  (which it is, in the default PHP configuration). (CVE-2009-4017)
  
  Note: This update introduces a new configuration option, max_file_uploads,
  used for limiting the number of files that can be uploaded in one request.
  By default, the limit is 20 files per request.
  
  It was discovered that PHP was affected by the previously published &quot;null
  prefix attack&quot;, caused by incorrect handling of NUL characters in X.509
  certificates. If an attacker is able to get a carefully-crafted certificate
  signed by a trusted Certificate Authority, the attacker could use the
  certificate during a man-in-the-middle attack and potentially confuse PHP
  into accepting it by mistake. (CVE-2009-3291)
  
  It was discovered that PHP's htmlspecialchars() function did not properly
  recognize partial multi-byte sequences for some multi-byte encodings,
  sending them to output without them being escaped. An attacker could use
  this flaw to perform a cross-site scripting attack. (CVE-2009-4142)
  
  All php users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to resolve these issues. After installing the updated
  packages, the httpd daemon must be restarted for the update to take effect.";
