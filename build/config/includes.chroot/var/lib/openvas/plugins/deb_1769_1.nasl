tag_insight = "Several vulnerabilities have been identified in OpenJDK, an
implementation of the Java SE platform.

Creation of large, temporary fonts could use up available disk space,
leading to a denial of service condition (CVE-2006-2426).

Several vulnerabilities existed in the embedded LittleCMS library,
exploitable through crafted images: a memory leak, resulting in a
denial of service condition (CVE-2009-0581), heap-based buffer
overflows, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution
(CVE-2009-0723, CVE-2009-0733), and a null-pointer dereference,
leading to denial of service (CVE-2009-0793).

The LDAP server implementation (in com.sun.jdni.ldap) did not properly
close sockets if an error was encountered, leading to a
denial-of-service condition (CVE-2009-1093).

The LDAP client implementation (in com.sun.jdni.ldap) allowed
malicious LDAP servers to execute arbitrary code on the client
(CVE-2009-1094).

The HTTP server implementation (sun.net.httpserver) contained an
unspecified denial of service vulnerability (CVE-2009-1101).

Several issues in Java Web Start have been addressed (CVE-2009-1095,
CVE-2009-1096, CVE-2009-1097, CVE-2009-1098).  The Debian packages
currently do not support Java Web Start, so these issues are not
directly exploitable, but the relevant code has been updated
nevertheless.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 9.1+lenny2.

We recommend that you upgrade your openjdk-6 packages.";
