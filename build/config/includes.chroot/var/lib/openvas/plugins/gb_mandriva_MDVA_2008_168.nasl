tag_insight = "The sound initialization scripts provided with Mandriva Linux 2009
  activate the Analog Loopback channel when it is present. This channel
  is present on most audio chipsets supported by the snd-hda-intel
  driver, which are commonly used on recent systems. When active,
  this channel plays back the sound received by the line-in and mic-in
  channels. If nothing is actually connected to these channels, this
  can result in an unpleasant loud noise over the speakers or headphones
  connected to the line-out or speaker-out connector.

  This update adjusts the sound initialization scripts to mute this
  channel by default. Unfortunately, this change will not be applied
  automatically on already-installed systems, as existing settings
  are automatically stored at shutdown and re-applied at startup on
  Mandriva Linux. If you are suffering from this issue, then you can
  run the command 'reset_sound' as root after installing this update,
  and it should resolve the issue. Alternatively, you can simply disable
  / mute the Analog Loopback channel yourself, using a mixer application.";
