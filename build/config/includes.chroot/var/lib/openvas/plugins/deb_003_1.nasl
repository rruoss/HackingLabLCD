it created the DEADJOE file securily but didn't write anything to it.
This has been fixed in version 2.8.15.2 .

This is the text from the previous advisory:

When joe (Joe's Own Editor) dies due to a signal instead of a normal
exit it saves a list of the files it is editing to a file called `DEADJOE'
in its current directory. Unfortunately this wasn't done safely which made
joe vulnerable to a symlink attack.";
