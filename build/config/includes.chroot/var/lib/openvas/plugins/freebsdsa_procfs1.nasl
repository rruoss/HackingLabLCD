process table inside the file system.  It is normally mounted on
/proc, and is required for the complete operation of programs such as
ps(1) and w(1).

The Linux process file system, linprocfs(5), emulates a subset of
Linux's process file system and is required for the complete operation
of some Linux binaries.

The implementation of the /proc/curproc/cmdline pseudofile in the procfs(5)
file system on FreeBSD 4.x and 5.x, and of the /proc/self/cmdline
pseudofile in the linprocfs(5) file system on FreeBSD 5.x reads a process'
argument vector from the process address space.  During this operation,
a pointer was dereferenced directly without the necessary validation
steps being performed.";
