tag_insight = "Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in Xulrunner, a
runtime environment for XUL applications, such as the Iceweasel web
browser. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:

CVE-2010-0174

Jesse Ruderman and Ehsan Akhgari discovered crashes in the layout
engine, which might allow the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2010-0175

It was discovered that incorrect memory handling in the XUL event
handler might allow the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2010-0176

It was discovered that incorrect memory handling in the XUL event
handler might allow the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2010-0177

It was discovered that incorrect memory handling in the plugin code
might allow the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2010-0178

Paul Stone discovered that forced drag-and-drop events could lead to
Chrome privilege escalation.

CVE-2010-0179

It was discovered that a programming error in the XMLHttpRequestSpy
module could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.


For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.9.0.19-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your xulrunner packages.";
