tag_insight = "The SYN cache (syncache) and SYN cookie mechanism (syncookie) are
features of the TCP/IP stack intended to improve resistance to a class
of denial of service attacks known as SYN floods.

Two related problems with syncache were triggered when syncookies were
implemented.

1) When a SYN was accepted via a syncookie, it used an uninitialized
pointer to find the TCP options for the new socket.  This pointer may
be a null pointer, which will cause the machine to crash.

2) A syncache entry is created when a SYN arrives on a listen socket.
If the application which created the listen socket was killed and
restarted --- and therefore recreated the listen socket with a
different inpcb --- an ACK (or duplicate SYN) which later arrived and
matched the existing syncache entry would cause a reference to the old
inpcb pointer.  Depending on the pointer's contents, this might result
in a system crash.

Because syncache/syncookies support was added prior to the release of
FreeBSD 4.5-RELEASE, no other releases are affected.";
