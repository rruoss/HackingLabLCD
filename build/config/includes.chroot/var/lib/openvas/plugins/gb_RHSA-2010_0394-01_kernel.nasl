  Security fixes:
  
  * RHSA-2009:1024 introduced a flaw in the ptrace implementation on Itanium
  systems. ptrace_check_attach() was not called during certain ptrace()
  requests. Under certain circumstances, a local, unprivileged user could use
  this flaw to call ptrace() on a process they do not own, giving them
  control over that process. (CVE-2010-0729, Important)
  
  * a flaw was found in the kernel's Unidirectional Lightweight Encapsulation
  (ULE) implementation. A remote attacker could send a specially-crafted ISO
  MPEG-2 Transport Stream (TS) frame to a target system, resulting in a
  denial of service. (CVE-2010-1086, Important)
  
  * a use-after-free flaw was found in tcp_rcv_state_process() in the
  kernel's TCP/IP protocol suite implementation. If a system using IPv6 had
  the IPV6_RECVPKTINFO option set on a listening socket, a remote attacker
  could send an IPv6 packet to that system, causing a kernel panic.
  (CVE-2010-1188, Important)
  
  * a divide-by-zero flaw was found in azx_position_ok() in the Intel High
  Definition Audio driver, snd-hda-intel. A local, unprivileged user could
  trigger this flaw to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2010-1085, Moderate)
  
  * an information leak flaw was found in the kernel's USB implementation.
  Certain USB errors could result in an uninitialized kernel buffer being
  sent to user-space. An attacker with physical access to a target system
  could use this flaw to cause an information leak. (CVE-2010-1083, Low)
  
  Red Hat would like to thank Ang Way Chuang for reporting CVE-2010-1086.
  
  Bug fixes:
  
  * a regression prevented the Broadcom BCM5761 network device from working
  when in the first (top) PCI-E slot of Hewlett-Packard (HP) Z600 systems.
  Note: The card worked in the 2nd or 3rd PCI-E slot. (BZ#567205)
  
  * the Xen hypervisor supports 168 GB of RAM for 32-bit guests. The physical
  address range was set incorrectly, however, causing 32-bit,
  para-virtualized Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.8 guests to crash when launched
  on AMD64 or Intel 64 hosts that have more than 64 GB of RAM. (BZ#574392)
  
  * RHSA-2009:1024 introduced a regression, causing diskdump to fail on
  systems with certain adapters using the qla2xxx driver. (BZ#577234)
  
  * a race condition caused TX to stop in a guest using the virtio_net
  driver. (BZ#580089)
  
  * on some systems, using the &quot;arp_validate=3&quot; bonding option caused both
