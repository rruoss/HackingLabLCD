CVE-2012-2846
Google Chrome before 21.0.1180.57 on Linux does not properly isolate
renderer processes, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (cross-process interference) via unspecified vectors.
CVE-2012-2847
Google Chrome before 21.0.1180.57 on Mac OS X and Linux, and before
21.0.1180.60 on Windows and Chrome Frame, does not request user
confirmation before continuing a large series of downloads, which
allows user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(resource consumption) via a crafted web site.
CVE-2012-2848
The drag-and-drop implementation in Google Chrome before 21.0.1180.57
on Mac OS X and Linux, and before 21.0.1180.60 on Windows and Chrome
Frame, allows user-assisted remote attackers to bypass intended file
access restrictions via a crafted web site.
CVE-2012-2849
Off-by-one error in the GIF decoder in Google Chrome before
21.0.1180.57 on Mac OS X and Linux, and before 21.0.1180.60 on Windows
and Chrome Frame, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(out-of-bounds read) via a crafted image.
CVE-2012-2850
Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in the PDF functionality in
Google Chrome before 21.0.1180.57 on Mac OS X and Linux, and before
21.0.1180.60 on Windows and Chrome Frame, allow remote attackers to
have an unknown impact via a crafted document.
CVE-2012-2851
Multiple integer overflows in the PDF functionality in Google Chrome
before 21.0.1180.57 on Mac OS X and Linux, and before 21.0.1180.60 on
Windows and Chrome Frame, allow remote attackers to cause a denial of
service or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted
document.
CVE-2012-2852
The PDF functionality in Google Chrome before 21.0.1180.57 on Mac OS X
and Linux, and before 21.0.1180.60 on Windows and Chrome Frame, does
not properly handle object linkage, which allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (use-after-free) or possibly have
unspecified other impact via a crafted document.
CVE-2012-2853
The webRequest API in Google Chrome before 21.0.1180.57 on Mac OS X
and Linux, and before 21.0.1180.60 on Windows and Chrome Frame, does
not properly interact with the Chrome Web Store, which allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified
other impact via a crafted web site.
CVE-2012-2854
Google Chrome before 21.0.1180.57 on Mac OS X and Linux, and before
21.0.1180.60 on Windows and Chrome Frame, allows remote attackers to
obtain potentially sensitive information about pointer values by
leveraging access to a WebUI renderer process.
CVE-2012-2855
Use-after-free vulnerability in the PDF functionality in Google Chrome
before 21.0.1180.57 on Mac OS X and Linux, and before 21.0.1180.60 on
Windows and Chrome Frame, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted
document.
CVE-2012-2856
The PDF functionality in Google Chrome before 21.0.1180.57 on Mac OS X
and Linux, and before 21.0.1180.60 on Windows and Chrome Frame, allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have
unspecified other impact via vectors that trigger out-of-bounds write
operations.
CVE-2012-2857
Use-after-free vulnerability in the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) DOM
implementation in Google Chrome before 21.0.1180.57 on Mac OS X and
Linux, and before 21.0.1180.60 on Windows and Chrome Frame, allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have
unspecified other impact via a crafted document.
CVE-2012-2858
Buffer overflow in the WebP decoder in Google Chrome before
21.0.1180.57 on Mac OS X and Linux, and before 21.0.1180.60 on Windows
and Chrome Frame, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted WebP image.
CVE-2012-2859
Google Chrome before 21.0.1180.57 on Linux does not properly handle
tabs, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause
a denial of service (application crash) via unspecified vectors.
CVE-2012-2860
The date-picker implementation in Google Chrome before 21.0.1180.57 on
Mac OS X and Linux, and before 21.0.1180.60 on Windows and Chrome
Frame, allows user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial of
service or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted web
site.";
