announced via advisory DSA 1225-1.

Several security related problems have been discovered in Mozilla and
derived products such as Mozilla Firefox.  The Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures project identifies the following vulnerabilities:

Tomas Kempinsky discovered that malformed FTP server responses
could lead to denial of service.

CVE-2006-5462

Ulrich Kühn discovered that the correction for a cryptographic
flaw in the handling of PKCS-1 certificates was incomplete, which
allows the forgery of certificates.

CVE-2006-5463

shutdown discovered that modification of JavaScript objects
during execution could lead to the execution of arbitrary
JavaScript bytecode.

CVE-2006-5464

Jesse Ruderman and Martijn Wargers discovered several crashes in
the layout engine, which might also allow execution of arbitrary
code.

CVE-2006-5748

Igor Bukanov and Jesse Ruderman discovered several crashes in the
JavaScript engine, which might allow execution of arbitrary code.

This update also adresses several crashes, which could be triggered by
malicious websites and fixes a regression introduced in the previous
Mozilla update.";
