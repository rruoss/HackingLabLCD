a commonly used network traffic analyser.  A remote attacker may be
able to overflow a buffer using a specially crafted packet.  More
problems have been discovered which don't apply to the version in
woody but are fixed in sid as well.

For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.4-1woody12.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.10.10-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your ethereal packages.";
