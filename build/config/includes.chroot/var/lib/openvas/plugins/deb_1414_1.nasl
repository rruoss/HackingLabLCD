tag_insight = "Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Wireshark
network traffic analyzer, which may lead to denial of service or the
execution of arbitrary code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2007-6114

Stefan Esser discovered a buffer overflow in the SSL dissector.
Fabiodds discovered a buffer overflow in the iSeries trace
dissector.

CVE-2007-6117

A programming error was discovered in the HTTP dissector, which may
lead to denial of service.

CVE-2007-6118

The MEGACO dissector could be tricked into ressource exhaustion.

CVE-2007-6120

The Bluetooth SDP dissector could be tricked into an endless loop.

CVE-2007-6121

The RPC portmap dissector could be tricked into dereferencing
a NULL pointer.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed
in version 0.99.4-5.etch.1. Updates packages for sparc will be provided
later.

For the old stable distribution (sarge), these problems have been
fixed in version 0.10.10-2sarge10. (In Sarge Wireshark used to be
called Ethereal). Updates packages for sparc and m68k will be provided
later.

We recommend that you upgrade your wireshark/ethereal packages.";
