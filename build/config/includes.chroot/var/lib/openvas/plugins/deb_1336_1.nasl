tag_insight = "Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in Mozilla Firefox.

This will be the last security update of Mozilla-based products for
the oldstable (sarge) distribution of Debian. We recommend to upgrade
to stable (etch) as soon as possible.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
vulnerabilities:

CVE-2007-1282

It was discovered that an integer overflow in text/enhanced message
parsing allows the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2007-0994

It was discovered that a regression in the Javascript engine allows
the execution of Javascript with elevated privileges.

CVE-2007-0995

It was discovered that incorrect parsing of invalid HTML characters
allows the bypass of content filters.

CVE-2007-0996

It was discovered that insecure child frame handling allows cross-site
scripting.

CVE-2007-0981

It was discovered that Firefox handles URI withs a null byte in the
hostname insecurely.

CVE-2007-0008

It was discovered that a buffer overflow in the NSS code allows the
execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2007-0009

It was discovered that a buffer overflow in the NSS code allows the
execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2007-0775

It was discovered that multiple programming errors in the layout engine
allow the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2007-0778

It was discovered that the page cache calculates hashes in an insecure
manner.

CVE-2006-6077

It was discovered that the password manager allows the disclosure of
passwords.

For the oldstable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.4-2sarge17. You should upgrade to etch as soon as possible.

The stable distribution (etch) isn't affected. These vulnerabilities have
been fixed prior to the release of Debian etch.

The unstable distribution (sid) no longer contains mozilla-firefox. Iceweasel
is already fixed.";
