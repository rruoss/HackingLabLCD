tag_insight = "maildrop is the mail filter/mail delivery agent that's used by the
  Courier Mail Server. This is a standalone build of the maildrop mail
  filter that can be used with other mail servers.

  maildrop is a replacement for your local mail delivery agent. maildrop
  reads a mail message from standard input, then delivers the message to
  your mailbox. maildrop knows how to deliver mail to mbox-style
  mailboxes, and maildirs.
  
  maildrop optionally reads instructions from a file, which describe how
  to filter incoming mail. These instructions can direct maildrop to
  deliver the message to an alternate mailbox, or forward it somewhere
  else. Unlike procmail, maildrop uses a structured filtering language.
  
  maildrop is written in C++, and is significantly larger than
  procmail. However, it uses resources much more efficiently. Unlike
  procmail, maildrop will not read a 10 megabyte mail message into
  memory. Large messages are saved in a temporary file, and are filtered
  from the temporary file. If the standard input to maildrop is a file,
  and not a pipe, a temporary file will not be necessary.
  
  maildrop checks the mail delivery instruction syntax from the filter
  file, before attempting to deliver a message. Unlike procmail, if the
  filter file contains syntax errors, maildrop terminates without
  delivering the message. The user can fix the typo without causing any
  mail to be lost.";
