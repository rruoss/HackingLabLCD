provides web access to some stored procedures. These procuedures,
without authentication, can allow users to access sensitive information
such as source code of applications, user credentials to other database
servers and run arbitrary SQL queries on servers accessed by the application
server.";

in http://otn.oracle.com/deploy/security/pdf/ias_modplsql_alert.pdf
which details how you can restrict unauthenticated access to procedures
using the exclusion_list parameter in the PL/SQL gateway configuration file:
/Apache/modplsql/cfg/wdbsvr.app.
