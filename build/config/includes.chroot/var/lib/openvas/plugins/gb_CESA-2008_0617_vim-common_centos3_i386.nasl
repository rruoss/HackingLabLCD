tag_insight = "Vim (Visual editor IMproved) is an updated and improved version of the vi
  editor.

  Several input sanitization flaws were found in Vim's keyword and tag
  handling. If Vim looked up a document's maliciously crafted tag or keyword,
  it was possible to execute arbitrary code as the user running Vim.
  (CVE-2008-4101)
  
  A heap-based overflow flaw was discovered in Vim's expansion of file name
  patterns with shell wildcards. An attacker could create a specially-crafted
  file or directory name that, when opened by Vim, caused the application to
  crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2008-3432)
  
  Several input sanitization flaws were found in various Vim system
  functions. If a user opened a specially crafted file, it was possible to
  execute arbitrary code as the user running Vim. (CVE-2008-2712)
  
  Ulf Härnhammar, of Secunia Research, discovered a format string flaw in
  Vim's help tag processor. If a user was tricked into executing the
  &quot;helptags&quot; command on malicious data, arbitrary code could be executed with
  the permissions of the user running Vim. (CVE-2007-2953)
  
  All Vim users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues.";
