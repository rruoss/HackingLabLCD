tag_insight = "Several remotely exploitable vulnerabilities have been discovered in the
TYPO3 web content management framework.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2009-0255
Chris John Riley discovered that the TYPO3-wide used encryption key is
generated with an insufficiently random seed resulting in low entropy
which makes it easier for attackers to crack this key.

CVE-2009-0256
Marcus Krause discovered that TYPO3 is not invalidating a supplied session
on authentication which allows an attacker to take over a victims
session via a session fixation attack.

CVE-2009-0257
Multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities allow remote attackers to
inject arbitrary web script or HTML via various arguments and user-
supplied strings used in the indexed search system extension, adodb
extension test scripts or the workspace module.

CVE-2009-0258
Mads Olesen discovered a remote command injection vulnerability in
the indexed search system extension which allows attackers to
execute arbitrary code via a crafted file name which is passed
unescaped to various system tools that extract file content for
the indexing.


Because of CVE-2009-0255, please make sure that besides installing
this update, you also create a new encryption key after the
installation.

For the stable distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed in
version 4.0.2+debian-7.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 4.2.5-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your TYPO3 packages.";
