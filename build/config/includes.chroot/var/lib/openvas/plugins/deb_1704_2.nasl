tag_insight = "The update in DSA 1704-1 was incomplete as it missed to escape a few
important characters which enabled an attacker to overwrite arbitrary
files.

It was discovered that netatalk, an implementation of the AppleTalk
suite, is affected by a command injection vulnerability when processing
PostScript streams via papd.  This is leading to arbitrary remote
code execution.  Note that this only affects installations that are
configured to use a pipe command in combination with wildcard symbols
substituted with values of the printed job.

For the stable distribution (etch) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.3-4+etch2.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.4~beta2-1.1.

We recommend that you upgrade your netatalk package.";
