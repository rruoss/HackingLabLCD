tag_insight = "It was discovered that reprepro, a tool to create a repository of Debian
packages, when updating from a remote site only checks for the validity of
known signatures, and thus does not reject packages with only unknown
signatures. This allows an attacker to bypass this authentication
mechanism.

The oldstable distribution (sarge) is not affected by this problem.

For the stable distribution (etch) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.1+1-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.4-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your reprepro package.";
