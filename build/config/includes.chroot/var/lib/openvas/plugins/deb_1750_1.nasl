tag_insight = "Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in libpng, a library for
reading and writing PNG files. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:

The png_handle_tRNS function allows attackers to cause a denial of
service (application crash) via a grayscale PNG image with a bad tRNS
chunk CRC value. (CVE-2007-2445)

Certain chunk handlers allow attackers to cause a denial of service
(crash) via crafted pCAL, sCAL, tEXt, iTXt, and ztXT chunking in PNG
images, which trigger out-of-bounds read operations. (CVE-2007-5269)

libpng allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service
(crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a PNG file with zero
length unknown chunks, which trigger an access of uninitialized
memory. (CVE-2008-1382)

The png_check_keyword might allow context-dependent attackers to set the
value of an arbitrary memory location to zero via vectors involving
creation of crafted PNG files with keywords. (CVE-2008-5907)

A memory leak in the png_handle_tEXt function allows context-dependent
attackers to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion) via a crafted
PNG file. (CVE-2008-6218)

libpng allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service
(application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted PNG
file that triggers a free of an uninitialized pointer in (1) the
png_read_png function, (2) pCAL chunk handling, or (3) setup of 16-bit
gamma tables. (CVE-2009-0040)

For the old stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed
in version1.2.15~beta5-1+etch2.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.27-2+lenny2.  (Only CVE-2008-5907, CVE-2008-5907 and
CVE-2009-0040 affect the stable distribution.)

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.35-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libpng packages.";
