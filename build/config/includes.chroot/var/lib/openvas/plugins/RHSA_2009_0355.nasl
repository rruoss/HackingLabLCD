tag_summary = "The remote host is missing updates announced in
advisory RHSA-2009:0355.

Evolution is the integrated collection of e-mail, calendaring, contact
management, communications, and personal information management (PIM) tools
for the GNOME desktop environment.

Evolution Data Server provides a unified back-end for applications which
interact with contacts, task and calendar information. Evolution Data
Server was originally developed as a back-end for Evolution, but is now
used by multiple other applications.

Evolution did not properly check the Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail
Extensions (S/MIME) signatures used for public key encryption and signing
of e-mail messages. An attacker could use this flaw to spoof a signature by
modifying the text of the e-mail message displayed to the user. (CVE-2009-0547)

It was discovered that evolution did not properly validate NTLM (NT LAN
Manager) authentication challenge packets. A malicious server using NTLM
authentication could cause evolution to disclose portions of its memory or
crash during user authentication. (CVE-2009-0582)

Multiple integer overflow flaws which could cause heap-based buffer
overflows were found in the Base64 encoding routines used by evolution and
evolution-data-server. This could cause evolution, or an application using
evolution-data-server, to crash, or, possibly, execute an arbitrary code
when large untrusted data blocks were Base64-encoded. (CVE-2009-0587)

All users of evolution and evolution-data-server are advised to upgrade to
these updated packages, which contain backported patches to correct these
issues. All running instances of evolution and evolution-data-server must
be restarted for the update to take effect.";
