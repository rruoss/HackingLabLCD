tag_insight = "This update fixes various security issues and some bugs in the SUSE Linux
  Enterprise 9 kernel.

  Following security issues were fixed:
  CVE-2010-2521: A crafted NFS write request might have caused a buffer overwrite,
  potentially causing a kernel crash.

  CVE-2008-0598: The x86_64 copy_to_user implementation might have leaked kernel
  memory depending on specific user buffer setups.

  CVE-2009-4537: drivers/net/r8169.c in the r8169 driver in the Linux kernel
  did not properly check the size of an Ethernet frame that exceeds the MTU,
  which allows remote attackers to (1) cause a denial of service (temporary
  network outage) via a packet with a crafted size, in conjunction with
  certain packets containing A characters and certain packets containing E
  characters; or (2) cause a denial of service (system crash) via a packet
  with a crafted size, in conjunction with certain packets containing '\0'
  characters, related to the value of the status register and erroneous
  behavior associated with the RxMaxSize register. NOTE: this vulnerability
  exists because of an incorrect fix for CVE-2009-1389.

  CVE-2010-1188: Use-after-free vulnerability in net/ipv4/tcp_input.c in
  the Linux kernel 2.6 when IPV6_RECVPKTINFO is set on a listening socket,
  allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (kernel panic)
  via a SYN packet while the socket is in a listening (TCP_LISTEN) state,
  which is not properly handled causes the skb structure to be freed.

  CVE-2008-3275: The (1) real_lookup and (2) __lookup_hash functions
  in fs/namei.c in the vfs implementation in the Linux kernel did not
  prevent creation of a child dentry for a deleted (aka S_DEAD) directory,
  which allowed local users to cause a denial of service (&quot;overflow&quot; of
  the UBIFS orphan area) via a series of attempted file creations within
  deleted directories.

  CVE-2007-6733: The nfs_lock function in fs/nfs/file.c in the Linux kernel
  did not properly remove POSIX locks on files that are setgid without
  group-execute permission, which allows local users to cause a denial of
  service (BUG and system crash) by locking a file on an NFS filesystem and
  then changing this files permissions, a related issue to CVE-2010-0727.

  CVE-2007-6206: The do_coredump function in fs/exec.c in Linux kernel
  did not change the UID of a core dump file if it exists before a root
  process creates a core dump in the same location, which might have allowed
  local users to obtain sensitive information.

  CVE-2010-1088: fs/namei.c in the Linux kernel did not always follow NFS
  automount &quot;sy ...
