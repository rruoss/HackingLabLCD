tag_insight = "Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Wireshark
network traffic analyzer, which may lead to the execution of arbitrary
code or denial of service. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2009-2560

A NULL pointer dereference was found in the RADIUS dissector.

CVE-2009-3550

A NULL pointer dereference was found in the DCERP/NT dissector.

CVE-2009-3829

An integer overflow was discovered in the ERF parser.

This update also includes fixes for three minor issues, which were
scheduled for the next stable point update. (CVE-2008-1829,
CVE-2009-2562, CVE-2009-3241). Also CVE-2009-1268 was fixed for Etch.
Since this security update was issued prior to the release of the
point update, the fixes were included.

For the old stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.99.4-5.etch.4.

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.2-3+lenny7.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.3-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your Wireshark packages.";
