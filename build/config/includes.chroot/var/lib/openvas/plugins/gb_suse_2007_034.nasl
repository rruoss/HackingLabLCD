tag_insight = "The Open Source PBX software Asterisk was updated
  to fix several security related bugs that allowed attackers to remotely
  crash asterisk or cause information leaks:

  - CVE-2007-1306: Asterisk allowed remote attackers to cause a denial
  of service (crash) by sending a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
  packet without a URI and SIP-version header, which results in a
  NULL pointer dereference.

  - CVE-2007-1561: The channel driver in Asterisk allowed remote
  attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a SIP INVITE
  message with an SDP containing one valid and one invalid IP address.

  - CVE-2007-1594: The handle_response function in chan_sip.c in Asterisk
  allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash)
  via a SIP Response code 0 in a SIP packet.

  - CVE-2007-1595: The Asterisk Extension Language (AEL) in pbx/pbx_ael.c
  in Asterisk does not properly generate extensions, which allows
  remote attackers to execute arbitrary extensions and have an unknown
  impact by specifying an invalid extension in a certain form.

  - CVE-2007-2294: The Manager Interface in Asterisk allowed
  remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) by using MD5
  authentication to authenticate a user that does not have a password
  defined in manager.conf, resulting in a NULL pointer dereference.

  - CVE-2007-2297: The SIP channel driver (chan_sip) in Asterisk did not
  properly parse SIP UDP packets that do not contain a valid response
  code, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
  (crash).

  - CVE-2007-2488: The IAX2 channel driver (chan_iax2) in Asterisk
  did not properly null terminate data, which allows remote attackers
  to trigger loss of transmitted data, and possibly obtain sensitive
  information (memory contents) or cause a denial of service
  (application crash), by sending a frame that lacks a 0 byte.";
