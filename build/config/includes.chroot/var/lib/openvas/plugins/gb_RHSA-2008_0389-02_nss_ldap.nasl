tag_insight = "The nss_ldap package contains the nss_ldap and pam_ldap modules. The
  nss_ldap module is a plug-in which allows applications to retrieve
  information about users and groups from a directory server. The pam_ldap
  module allows PAM-aware applications to use a directory server to verify
  user passwords.

  A race condition was discovered in nss_ldap which affected certain
  applications which make LDAP connections, such as Dovecot. This could cause
  nss_ldap to answer a request for information about one user with
  information about a different user. (CVE-2007-5794)
  
  In addition, these updated packages fix the following bugs:
  
  * a build error prevented the nss_ldap module from being able to use DNS to
  discover the location of a directory server. For example, when the
  /etc/nsswitch.conf configuration file was configured to use &quot;ldap&quot;, but no
  &quot;host&quot; or &quot;uri&quot; option was configured in the /etc/ldap.conf configuration
  file, no directory server was contacted, and no results were returned.
  
  * the &quot;port&quot; option in the /etc/ldap.conf configuration file on client
  machines was ignored. For example, if a directory server which you were
  attempting to use was listening on a non-default port (i.e. not ports 389
  or 636), it was only possible to use that directory server by including the
  port number in the &quot;uri&quot; option. In this updated package, the &quot;port&quot; option
  works as expected.
  
  * pam_ldap failed to change an expired password if it had to follow a
  referral to do so, which could occur, for example, when using a slave
  directory server in a replicated environment. An error such as the
  following occurred after entering a new password: &quot;LDAP password
  information update failed: Can't contact LDAP server Insufficient 'write'
  privilege to the 'userPassword' attribute&quot;
  
  This has been resolved in this updated package.
  
  * when the &quot;pam_password exop_send_old&quot; password-change method was
  configured in the /etc/ldap.conf configuration file, a logic error in the
  pam_ldap module caused client machines to attempt to change a user's
  password twice. First, the pam_ldap module attempted to change the password
  using the &quot;exop&quot; request, and then again using an LDAP modify request.
  
  * on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.1, rebuilding nss_ldap-253-5.el5 when the
  krb5-*-1.6.1-17.el5 packages were installed failed due to an error such as
  the following:
  
  	+ /builddir/build/SOURCES/dlopen.sh ./nss_ldap-253/nss_ldap.so
  	dlopen() of &quot;././nss_l ...
