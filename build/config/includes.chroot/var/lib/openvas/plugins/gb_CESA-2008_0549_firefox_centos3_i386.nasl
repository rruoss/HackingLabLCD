  Multiple flaws were found in the processing of malformed JavaScript
  content. A web page containing such malicious content could cause Firefox
  to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code as the user running
  Firefox. (CVE-2008-2801, CVE-2008-2802, CVE-2008-2803)
  
  Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
  page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code as the user running Firefox.
  (CVE-2008-2798, CVE-2008-2799, CVE-2008-2811)
  
  Several flaws were found in the way malformed web content was displayed. A
  web page containing specially-crafted content could potentially trick a
  Firefox user into surrendering sensitive information. (CVE-2008-2800)
  
  Two local file disclosure flaws were found in Firefox. A web page
  containing malicious content could cause Firefox to reveal the contents of
  a local file to a remote attacker. (CVE-2008-2805, CVE-2008-2810)
  
  A flaw was found in the way a malformed .properties file was processed by
  Firefox. A malicious extension could read uninitialized memory, possibly
  leaking sensitive data to the extension. (CVE-2008-2807)
  
  A flaw was found in the way Firefox escaped a listing of local file names.
  If a user could be tricked into listing a local directory containing
  malicious file names, arbitrary JavaScript could be run with the
  permissions of the user running Firefox. (CVE-2008-2808)
  
  A flaw was found in the way Firefox displayed information about self-signed
  certificates. It was possible for a self-signed certificate to contain
  multiple alternate name entries, which were not all displayed to the user,
  allowing them to mistakenly extend trust to an unknown site.
  (CVE-2008-2809)
  
  All Mozilla Firefox users should upgrade to this updated package, which
  contains backported patches that correct these issues.";
