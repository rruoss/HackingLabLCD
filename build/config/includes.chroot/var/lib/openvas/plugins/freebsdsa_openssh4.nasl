tag_insight = "OpenSSH is an implementation of the SSH protocol suite, providing an
encrypted and authenticated transport for a variety of services,
including remote shell access.  The OpenSSH server daemon (sshd)
provides support for the X11 protocol by binding to a port on the
server and forwarding any connections which are made to that port.

When logging in via SSH with X11-forwarding enabled, sshd(8) fails to
correctly handle the case where it fails to bind to an IPv4 port but
successfully binds to an IPv6 port.  In this case, applications which
use X11 will connect to the IPv4 port, even though it had not been
bound by sshd(8) and is therefore not being securely forwarded.";
