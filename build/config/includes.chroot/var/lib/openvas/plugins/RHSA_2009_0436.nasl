advisory RHSA-2009:0436.

Mozilla Firefox is an open source Web browser. XULRunner provides the XUL
Runtime environment for Mozilla Firefox.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code as the user running Firefox.
(CVE-2009-1302, CVE-2009-1303, CVE-2009-1304, CVE-2009-1305)

Several flaws were found in the way malformed web content was processed. A
web page containing malicious content could execute arbitrary JavaScript in
the context of the site, possibly presenting misleading data to a user, or
stealing sensitive information such as login credentials. (CVE-2009-0652,
CVE-2009-1306, CVE-2009-1307, CVE-2009-1308, CVE-2009-1309, CVE-2009-1310,
CVE-2009-1312)

A flaw was found in the way Firefox saved certain web pages to a local
file. If a user saved the inner frame of a web page containing POST data,
the POST data could be revealed to the inner frame, possibly surrendering
sensitive information such as login credentials. (CVE-2009-1311)

For technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security
advisories for Firefox 3.0.9. You can find a link to the Mozilla advisories
in the References section of this errata.

All Firefox users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
Firefox version 3.0.9, which corrects these issues. After installing the
update, Firefox must be restarted for the changes to take effect.";
