tag_insight = "The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) of the TCP/IP protocol suite
provides a connection-oriented, reliable, sequence-preserving data
stream service.  TCP timestamps are used to measure Round-Trip Time
and in the Protect Against Wrapped Sequences (PAWS) algorithm.  TCP
packets with the SYN flag set are used during setup of new TCP
connections.

Two problems have been discovered in the FreeBSD TCP stack.

First, when a TCP packets containing a timestamp is received, inadequate
checking of sequence numbers is performed, allowing an attacker to
artificially increase the internal recent timestamp for a connection.

Second, a TCP packet with the SYN flag set is accepted for established
connections, allowing an attacker to overwrite certain TCP options.";
