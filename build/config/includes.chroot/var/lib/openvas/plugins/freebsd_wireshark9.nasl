CVE-2012-5237
The dissect_hsrp function in epan/dissectors/packet-hsrp.c in the HSRP
dissector in Wireshark 1.8.x before 1.8.3 allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via a malformed packet.
CVE-2012-5238
epan/dissectors/packet-ppp.c in the PPP dissector in Wireshark 1.8.x
before 1.8.3 uses incorrect OUI data structures during the decoding of
(1) PPP and (2) LCP data, which allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (assertion failure and application exit) via a
malformed packet.
CVE-2012-5240
Buffer overflow in the dissect_tlv function in
epan/dissectors/packet-ldp.c in the LDP dissector in Wireshark 1.8.x
before 1.8.3 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a
malformed packet.";
