Ubuntu 6.06 LTS:
  python2.4-moinmoin              1.5.2-1ubuntu2.4

Ubuntu 7.10:
  python-moinmoin                 1.5.7-3ubuntu2.1

Ubuntu 8.04 LTS:

Ubuntu 8.10:
  python-moinmoin                 1.7.1-1ubuntu1.1

In general, a standard system upgrade is sufficient to effect the
necessary changes.

input when processing login requests, resulting in cross-site scripting (XSS)
vulnerabilities. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were
tricked into viewing server output during a crafted server request, a remote
attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data,
within the same domain. This issue affected Ubuntu 7.10 and 8.04 LTS.
(CVE-2008-0780)

Fernando Quintero discovered that MoinMoin did not properly sanitize its input
when attaching files, resulting in cross-site scripting vulnerabilities. This
issue affected Ubuntu 6.06 LTS, 7.10 and 8.04 LTS. (CVE-2008-0781)

It was discovered that MoinMoin did not properly sanitize its input when
processing user forms. A remote attacker could submit crafted cookie values and
overwrite arbitrary files via directory traversal. This issue affected Ubuntu
6.06 LTS, 7.10 and 8.04 LTS. (CVE-2008-0782)

It was discovered that MoinMoin did not properly sanitize its input when
editing pages, resulting in cross-site scripting vulnerabilities. This issue
only affected Ubuntu 6.06 LTS and 7.10. (CVE-2008-1098)

It was discovered that MoinMoin did not properly enforce access controls,
which could allow a remoter attacker to view private pages. This issue only
affected Ubuntu 6.06 LTS and 7.10. (CVE-2008-1099)

It was discovered that MoinMoin did not properly sanitize its input when
attaching files and using the rename parameter, resulting in cross-site
scripting vulnerabilities. (CVE-2009-0260)

It was discovered that MoinMoin did not properly sanitize its input when
displaying error messages after processing spam, resulting in cross-site
scripting vulnerabilities. (CVE-2009-0312)";
