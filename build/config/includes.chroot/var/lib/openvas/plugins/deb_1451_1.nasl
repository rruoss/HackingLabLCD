tag_insight = "Several local/remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the MySQL
database server. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:

CVE-2007-3781

It was discovered that privilege validation for the source table
of CREATE TABLE LIKE statements was insufficiently enforced, which
might lead to information disclosure. This is only exploitable by
authenticated users.

CVE-2007-5969

It was discovered that symbolic links were handled insecurely during
the creation of tables with DATA DIRECTORY or INDEX DIRECTORY
statements, which might lead to denial of service by overwriting
data. This is only exploitable by authenticated users.

CVE-2007-6304

It was discovered that queries to data in a FEDERATED table can
lead to a crash of the local database server, if the remote server
returns information with less columns than expected, resulting in
denial of service.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.0.51-1.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.0.32-7etch4.

The the old stable distribution (sarge) doesn't contain mysql-dfsg-5.0.

We recommend that you upgrade your mysql-dfsg-5.0 packages.";
