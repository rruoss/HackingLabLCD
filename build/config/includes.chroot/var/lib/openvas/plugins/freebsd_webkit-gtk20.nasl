CVE-2010-1782
WebKit in Apple Safari before 5.0.1 on Mac OS X 10.5 through 10.6 and Windows, and before
4.1.1 on Mac OS X 10.4, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial
of service.

CVE-2010-1784
The counters functionality in the CSS implementation in WebKit in Apple Safari before 5.0.1
on Mac OS X 10.5 through 10.6 and Windows, and before 4.1.1 on Mac OS X 10.4, allows remote

WebKit in Apple Safari before 5.0.1 on Mac OS X 10.5 through 10.6 and Windows, and before
4.1.1 on Mac OS X 10.4, accesses uninitialized memory during processing of the (1)
:first-letter and (2) :first-line pseudo-elements in an SVG text element, which allows remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service.

CVE-2010-1786
Use-after-free vulnerability in WebKit in Apple Safari before 5.0.1 on Mac OS X 10.5 through
10.6 and Windows, and before 4.1.1 on Mac OS X 10.4, allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary code or cause a denial of service via a foreignObject element in an SVG document.

CVE-2010-1787
WebKit in Apple Safari before 5.0.1 on Mac OS X 10.5 through 10.6 and Windows, and before
4.1.1 on Mac OS X 10.4, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial
of service.

WebKit in Apple Safari before 5.0.1 on Mac OS X 10.5 through 10.6 and Windows, and before
4.1.1 on Mac OS X 10.4, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial
of service.

Multiple use-after-free vulnerabilities in WebKit in Apple Safari before 5.0.1 on Mac OS X
10.5 through 10.6 and Windows, and before 4.1.1 on Mac OS X 10.4, allow remote attackers to
