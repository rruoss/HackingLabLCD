CVE-2012-0217
The x86-64 kernel system-call functionality in Xen 4.1.2 and earlier,
as used in Citrix XenServer 6.0.2 and earlier and other products;
Oracle Solaris 11 and earlier; illumos before r13724; Joyent SmartOS
before 20120614T184600Z; FreeBSD before 9.0-RELEASE-p3; NetBSD 6.0
Beta and earlier; and Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 and R2 SP1 and
Windows 7 Gold and SP1, when running on an Intel processor,
incorrectly uses the sysret path in cases where a certain address is
not a canonical address, which allows local users to gain privileges
via a crafted application.  NOTE: this description clearly does not
belong in CVE, because a single entry cannot be about independent
codebases; however, there was some value in preserving the original
mapping of the multi-codebase coordinated-disclosure effort to a
single identifier.";
