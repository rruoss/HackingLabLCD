a Python Web framework. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

CVE-2012-3442Two functions do not validate the scheme of a redirect target,
which might allow remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting
(XSS) attacks via a data: URL.

CVE-2012-3443The ImageField class completely decompresses image data during image
validation, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(memory consumption) by uploading an image file.

CVE-2012-3444The get_image_dimensions function in the image-handling functionality
uses a constant chunk size in all attempts to determine dimensions,
which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (process
or thread consumption) via a large TIFF image.";
