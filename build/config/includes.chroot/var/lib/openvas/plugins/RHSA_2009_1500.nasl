Xpdf is an X Window System based viewer for Portable Document Format (PDF)
files.

Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in Xpdf. An attacker could
create a malicious PDF file that would cause Xpdf to crash or, potentially,
execute arbitrary code when opened. (CVE-2009-0791, CVE-2009-3604,
CVE-2009-3606, CVE-2009-3609)

Red Hat would like to thank Adam Zabrocki for reporting the CVE-2009-3604
