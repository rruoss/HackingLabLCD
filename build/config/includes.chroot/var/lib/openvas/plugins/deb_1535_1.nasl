tag_insight = "Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Iceweasel
web browser, an unbranded version of the Firefox browser. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:

CVE-2007-4879

Peter Brodersen and Alexander Klink discovered that the
autoselection of SSL client certificates could lead to users
being tracked, resulting in a loss of privacy.

CVE-2008-1233

moz_bug_r_a4 discovered that variants of CVE-2007-3738 and
CVE-2007-5338 allow the execution of arbitrary code through
XPCNativeWrapper.

CVE-2008-1234

moz_bug_r_a4 discovered that insecure handling of event
handlers could lead to cross-site scripting.

CVE-2008-1235

Boris Zbarsky, Johnny Stenback, and moz_bug_r_a4 discovered
that incorrect principal handling can lead to cross-site
scripting and the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2008-1236

Tom Ferris, Seth Spitzer, Martin Wargers, John Daggett and Mats
Palmgren discovered crashes in the layout engine, which might
allow the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2008-1237

georgi, tgirmann and Igor Bukanov discovered crashes in the
Javascript engine, which might allow the execution of arbitrary
code.

CVE-2008-1238

Gregory Fleischer discovered that HTTP Referrer headers were
handled incorrectly in combination with URLs containing Basic
Authentication credentials with empty usernames, resulting
in potential Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.

CVE-2008-1240

Gregory Fleischer discovered that web content fetched through
the jar: protocol can use Java to connect to arbitrary ports.
This is only an issue in combination with the non-free Java
plugin.

CVE-2008-1241

Chris Thomas discovered that background tabs could generate
XUL popups overlaying the current tab, resulting in potential
spoofing attacks.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.0.13-0etch1.

The Mozilla products from the old stable distribution (sarge) are no
longer supported.

We recommend that you upgrade your iceweasel packages.";
