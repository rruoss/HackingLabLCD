tag_insight = "This update fixes several issues in draksnapshot:

  The draksnapshot applet received the following fixes:
  
  - on desktop startup, it will wait for 30s before checking for
  available disc so that notification is positioned at the right place,
  on the applet icon
  - it prevents crashing if DBus is not reachable, and reports DBus
  errors
  - it prevents crashing if DBus is active, but HAL is not (#44434)
  - if all discs are unmounted, the applet will hide (#41176)
  - it prevents running more than once
  - it uses HAL in order to detect discs available for backup, thus
  fixing detecting some internal SATA discs as discs available for backup
  (#41107)
  
  It also uses new icons from Mandriva Linux 2009.0.
  
  The draksnapshot configuration tool also received the following fixes:
  
  - it stops saving config when clicking Close (#39790); one has to
  click on Apply in order to save the config
  - on first run, it offers backup in mounted disc path, instead of
  defaulting to some place in the root filesystem which could previously
  be filled up (#39802)
  - it no longer offers to configure some obscure advanced options
  - it now allows for disabling backups
  - it generates anacron-friendly cron files";
