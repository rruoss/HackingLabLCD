tag_insight = "Jason Molenda and Hiromitsu Takagi found ways to exploit cross site
scripting bugs in mhonarc, a mail to HTML converter.  When processing
maliciously crafted mails of type text/html, mhonarc, does not
deactivate all scripting parts properly.  This is fixed in upstream
version 2.5.3.

If you are worried about security, it is recommended that you disable
support of text/html messages in your mail archives.  There is no
guarantee that the mhtxthtml.pl library is robust enough to eliminate
all possible exploits that can occur with HTML data.

To exclude HTML data, you can use the MIMEEXCS resource.  For example:

<MIMEExcs>
text/html
text/x-html
</MIMEExcs>

The use of text/x-html is probably not used any more, but is good to
include it, just-in-case.

If you are concerend that this could block out the entire contents of
some messages, then you could do the following instead:

<MIMEFilters>
text/html; m2h_text_plain::filter; mhtxtplain.pl
text/x-html; m2h_text_plain::filter; mhtxtplain.pl
</MIMEFilters>

This treats the HTML as text/plain.

The above problems have been fixed in version 2.5.2-1.1 for the
current stable stable distribution (woody), in version 2.4.4-1.1 for
the old stable distribution (potato) and in version 2.5.11-1 for the
unstable distribution (sid).

We recommend that you upgrade your mhonarc packages.";
