released revealing a potential problem found by Peter Kelly. This
problem involved incorrect protection of data updating for Image and
File objects: any user with DTML editing privileges could update the

This has been fixed in version 2.1.6-5.4 by including the 2000-12-19
hotfix, and we recommend that you upgrade your zope package immediately.";
