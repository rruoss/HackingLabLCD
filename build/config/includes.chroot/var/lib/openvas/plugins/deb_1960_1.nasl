tag_insight = "It was discovered that acpid, the Advanced Configuration and Power
Interface event daemon, on the oldstable distribution (etch) creates
its log file with weak permissions, which might expose sensible
information or might be abused by a local user to consume all free disk
space on the same partition of the file.


For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.4-5etch2.

The stable distribution (lenny) in version 1.0.8-1lenny2 and the
unstable distribution (sid) in version 1.0.10-5, have been updated to
fix the weak file permissions of the log file created by older
versions.


We recommend that you upgrade your acpid packages.";
