  An integer truncation error, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was
  found in the way the OpenOffice.org Impress presentation application
  sanitized a file's dictionary property items. An attacker could use this
  flaw to create a specially-crafted Microsoft Office PowerPoint file that,
  when opened, would cause OpenOffice.org Impress to crash or, possibly,
  execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  OpenOffice.org Impress. (CVE-2010-2935)

  An integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was
  found in the way OpenOffice.org Impress processed polygons in input
  documents. An attacker could use this flaw to create a specially-crafted
  Microsoft Office PowerPoint file that, when opened, would cause
  OpenOffice.org Impress to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with
  the privileges of the user running OpenOffice.org Impress. (CVE-2010-2936)

  All users of OpenOffice.org are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues. For Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 3, this erratum provides updated openoffice.org
  packages. For Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, this erratum provides updated
  openoffice.org and openoffice.org2 packages. All running instances of
  OpenOffice.org applications must be restarted for this update to take
  effect.";
