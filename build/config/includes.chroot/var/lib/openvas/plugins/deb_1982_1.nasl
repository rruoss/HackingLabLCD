tag_insight = "Julien Cristau discovered that hybserv, a daemon running IRC services
for IRCD-Hybrid, is prone to a denial of service attack via the commands
option.


For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.9.2-4+lenny2.

Due to a bug in the archive system, it is not possible to release the
fix for the oldstable distribution (etch) simultaneously. Therefore,
etch will be fixed in version 1.9.2-4+etch1 as soon as it becomes
available.

For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.9.2-4.1.


We recommend that you upgrade your hybserv packages.";
