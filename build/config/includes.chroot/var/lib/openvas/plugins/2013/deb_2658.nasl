concurrency control. Graphical user interfaces and bindings for many
programming languages are available as well.";

DSA-2657-1 has been released for CVE-2013-1900 

affecting posgresql-8.4.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 9.1.9-0wheezy1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 9.1.9-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your postgresql-9.1 packages.";

CVE-2013-1899Mitsumasa Kondo and Kyotaro Horiguchi of NTT Open Source Software Center
discovered that it was possible for a connection request containing a
database name that begins with - 
to be crafted that can damage or
destroy files within a server's data directory. Anyone with access to the
port the PostgreSQL server listens on can initiate this request.

CVE-2013-1900 
Random numbers generated by contrib/pgcrypto functions may be easy for
another database user to guess.

CVE-2013-1901 
An unprivileged user could run commands that could interfere with
in-progress backups.";
