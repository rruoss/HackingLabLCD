tag_insight = "Multiple memory safety issues were discovered in Thunderbird. If the user
  were tricked into opening a specially crafted message with scripting
  enabled, an attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of
  service via application crash, or potentially execute arbitrary code with
  the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. (CVE-2013-1682)

  Abhishek Arya discovered multiple use-after-free bugs. If the user were
  tricked into opening a specially crafted message with scripting enabled,
  an attacker could possibly exploit these to execute arbitrary code with
  the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. (CVE-2013-1684,
  CVE-2013-1685, CVE-2013-1686)

  Mariusz Mlynski discovered that user defined code within the XBL scope of
  an element could be made to bypass System Only Wrappers (SOW). If a user
  had scripting enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit this to
  execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking
  Thunderbird. (CVE-2013-1687)

  A crash was discovered when reloading a page that contained content using
  the onreadystatechange event. If a user had scripting enabled, an attacker
  could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the
  privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. (CVE-2013-1690)

  Johnathan Kuskos discovered that Thunderbird sent data in the body of
  XMLHttpRequest HEAD requests. If a user had scripting enabled, an attacker
  could exploit this to conduct Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
  (CVE-2013-1692)

  Paul Stone discovered a timing flaw in the processing of SVG images with
  filters. If a user had scripting enabled, an attacker could exploit this
  to view sensitive information. (CVE-2013-1693)

  Boris Zbarsky discovered a flaw in PreserveWrapper. If a user had
  scripting enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause
  a denial of service via application crash, or execute code with the
  privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. (CVE-2013-1694)

  It was discovered that XrayWrappers could be bypassed to call
  content-defined methods in certain circumstances. If a user had scripting
  enabled, an attacker could exploit this to cause undefined behaviour.
