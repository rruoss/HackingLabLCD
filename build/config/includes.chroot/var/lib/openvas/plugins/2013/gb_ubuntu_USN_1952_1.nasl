  tag_insight = "Multiple memory safety issues were discovered in Thunderbird. If a user
were tricked in to opening a specially crafted message with scripting
enabled, an attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of
service via application crash, or potentially execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. (CVE-2013-1718)

Atte Kettunen discovered a flaw in the HTML5 Tree Builder when interacting
with template elements. If a user had scripting enabled, in some
circumstances an attacker could potentially exploit this to execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird.
(CVE-2013-1720)

Alex Chapman discovered an integer overflow vulnerability in the ANGLE
library. If a user had scripting enabled, an attacker could potentially
exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
invoking Thunderbird. (CVE-2013-1721)

Abhishek Arya discovered a use-after-free in the Animation Manager. If
a user had scripting enabled, an attacked could potentially exploit this
to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking
Thunderbird. (CVE-2013-1722)

Scott Bell discovered a use-after-free when using a select element. If
a user had scripting enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit this
to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking
Thunderbird. (CVE-2013-1724)

It was discovered that the scope of new Javascript objects could be
accessed before their compartment is initialized. If a user had scripting
enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit this to execute code with
the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. (CVE-2013-1725)

Dan Gohman discovered that some variables and data were used in IonMonkey,
without being initialized, which could lead to information leakage.
(CVE-2013-1728)

Sachin Shinde discovered a crash when moving some XBL-backed nodes
in to a document created by document.open(). If a user had scripting
enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial
of service. (CVE-2013-1730)

Aki Helin discovered a buffer overflow when combining lists, floats and
multiple columns. If a user had scripting enabled, an attacker could
potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges
of the user invoking Thunderbird. (CVE-2013-1732)

Two memory corruption bugs when scrolling were discovered. If a user had
scripting enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a
denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. (CVE-201 ...
