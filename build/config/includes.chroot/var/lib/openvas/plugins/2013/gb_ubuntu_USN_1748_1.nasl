tag_insight = "Bobby Holley discovered vulnerabilities in Chrome Object Wrappers (COW) and
  System Only Wrappers (SOW). If a user were tricked into opening a specially
  crafted page and had scripting enabled, a remote attacker could exploit
  this to bypass security protections to obtain sensitive information or
  potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking
  Thunderbird. (CVE-2013-0773)

  Frederik Braun discovered that Thunderbird made the location of the active
  browser profile available to JavaScript workers. Scripting for Thunderbird
  is disabled by default in Ubuntu. (CVE-2013-0774)

  A use-after-free vulnerability was discovered in Thunderbird. An attacker
  could potentially exploit this to execute code with the privileges of the
  user invoking Thunderbird if scripting were enabled. (CVE-2013-0775)

  Michal Zalewski discovered that Thunderbird would not always show the
  correct address when cancelling a proxy authentication prompt. A remote
  attacker could exploit this to conduct URL spoofing and phishing attacks
  if scripting were enabled.
  (CVE-2013-0776)

  Abhishek Arya discovered several problems related to memory handling. If
  the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker
  could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via application
  crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking
  Thunderbird. (CVE-2013-0777, CVE-2013-0778, CVE-2013-0779, CVE-2013-0780,
  CVE-2013-0781, CVE-2013-0782)

  Olli Pettay, Christoph Diehl, Gary Kwong, Jesse Ruderman, Andrew McCreight,
  Joe Drew, Wayne Mery, Alon Zakai, Christian Holler, Gary Kwong, Luke
  Wagner, Terrence Cole, Timothy Nikkel, Bill McCloskey, and Nicolas Pierron
  discovered multiple memory safety issues affecting Thunderbird. If a user
  had scripting enabled and was tricked into opening a specially crafted
  page, an attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service
  via application crash. (CVE-2013-0783, CVE-2013-0784)";
