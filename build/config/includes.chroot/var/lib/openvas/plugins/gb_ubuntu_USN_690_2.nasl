tag_insight = "Several flaws were discovered in the browser engine. These problems could allow
  an attacker to crash the browser and possibly execute arbitrary code with user
  privileges. (CVE-2008-5500)

  Boris Zbarsky discovered that the same-origin check in Firefox could be
  bypassed by utilizing XBL-bindings. An attacker could exploit this to read data
  from other domains. (CVE-2008-5503)
  
  Several problems were discovered in the JavaScript engine. An attacker could
  exploit feed preview vulnerabilities to execute scripts from page content with
  chrome privileges. (CVE-2008-5504)
  
  Marius Schilder discovered that Firefox did not properly handle redirects to
  an outside domain when an XMLHttpRequest was made to a same-origin resource.
  It's possible that sensitive information could be revealed in the
  XMLHttpRequest response. (CVE-2008-5506)
  
  Chris Evans discovered that Firefox did not properly protect a user's data when
  accessing a same-domain Javascript URL that is redirected to an unparsable
  Javascript off-site resource. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious
  website, an attacker may be able to steal a limited amount of private data.
  (CVE-2008-5507)
  
  Chip Salzenberg, Justin Schuh, Tom Cross, and Peter William discovered Firefox
  did not properly parse URLs when processing certain control characters.
  (CVE-2008-5508)
  
  Kojima Hajime discovered that Firefox did not properly handle an escaped null
  character. An attacker may be able to exploit this flaw to bypass script
  sanitization. (CVE-2008-5510)
  
  Several flaws were discovered in the Javascript engine. If a user were tricked
  into opening a malicious website, an attacker could exploit this to execute
  arbitrary Javascript code within the context of another website or with chrome
  privileges. (CVE-2008-5511, CVE-2008-5512)
  
  Flaws were discovered in the session-restore feature of Firefox. If a user were
  tricked into opening a malicious website, an attacker could exploit this to
  perform cross-site scripting attacks or execute arbitrary Javascript code with
  chrome privileges. (CVE-2008-5513)";
