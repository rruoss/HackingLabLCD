tag_insight = "The GnuTLS library provides support for cryptographic algorithms and for
  protocols such as Transport Layer Security (TLS).

  A flaw was found in the way the TLS/SSL (Transport Layer Security/Secure
  Sockets Layer) protocols handled session renegotiation. A man-in-the-middle
  attacker could use this flaw to prefix arbitrary plain text to a client's
  session (for example, an HTTPS connection to a website). This could force
  the server to process an attacker's request as if authenticated using the
  victim's credentials. This update addresses this flaw by implementing the
  TLS Renegotiation Indication Extension, as defined in RFC 5746.
  (CVE-2009-3555)
  
  Refer to the following Knowledgebase article for additional details about
  the CVE-2009-3555 flaw: http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-20491 
  
  A flaw was found in the way GnuTLS extracted serial numbers from X.509
  certificates. On 64-bit big endian platforms, this flaw could cause the
  certificate revocation list (CRL) check to be bypassed; cause various
  GnuTLS utilities to crash; or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.
  (CVE-2010-0731)
  
  Users of GnuTLS are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. For the update to take
  effect, all applications linked to the GnuTLS library must be restarted, or
  the system rebooted.";
