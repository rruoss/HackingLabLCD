tag_summary = "The remote host is missing updates announced in
advisory RHSA-2009:1083.

The Common UNIX® Printing System (CUPS) provides a portable printing layer
for UNIX operating systems. The Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) allows
users to print and manage printing-related tasks over a network. The CUPS
pdftops filter converts Portable Document Format (PDF) files to
PostScript. pdftops is based on Xpdf and the CUPS imaging library.

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the CUPS IPP routine, used for
processing incoming IPP requests for the CUPS scheduler. An attacker could
use this flaw to send specially-crafted IPP requests that would crash the
cupsd daemon. (CVE-2009-0949)

A use-after-free flaw was found in the CUPS scheduler directory services
routine, used to process data about available printers and printer classes.
An attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service (cupsd daemon
stop or crash). (CVE-2009-1196)

Multiple integer overflows flaws, leading to heap-based buffer overflows,
were found in the CUPS pdftops filter. An attacker could create a
malicious PDF file that would cause pdftops to crash or, potentially,
execute arbitrary code as the lp user if the file was printed.
(CVE-2009-0791)

Red Hat would like to thank Anibal Sacco from Core Security Technologies
for reporting the CVE-2009-0949 flaw, and Swen van Brussel for reporting
the CVE-2009-1196 flaw.

Users of cups are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing this
update, the cupsd daemon will be restarted automatically.";
