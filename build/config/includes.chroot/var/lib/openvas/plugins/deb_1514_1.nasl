tag_insight = "Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in MoinMoin, a
Python clone of WikiWiki. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2007-2423

A cross-site-scripting vulnerability has been discovered in
attachment handling.

CVE-2007-2637

Access control lists for calendars and includes were
insufficiently enforced, which could lead to information
disclosure.

CVE-2008-0780

A cross-site-scripting vulnerability has been discovered in
the login code.

CVE-2008-0781

A cross-site-scripting vulnerability has been discovered in
attachment handling.

CVE-2008-0782

A directory traversal vulnerability in cookie handling could
lead to local denial of service by overwriting files.

CVE-2008-1098

Cross-site-scripting vulnerabilities have been discovered in
the GUI editor formatter and the code to delete pages.

CVE-2008-1099

The macro code validates access control lists insufficiently,
which could lead to information disclosure.


For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.5.3-1.2etch1. This update also includes a bugfix wrt the
encoding of password reminder mails, which doesn't have security
implications.

The old stable distribution (sarge) will not be updated due to
the many changes and support for Sarge ending end of this month
anyway. You're advised to upgrade to the stable distribution if
you run moinmoin.

We recommend that you upgrade your moin package.";
