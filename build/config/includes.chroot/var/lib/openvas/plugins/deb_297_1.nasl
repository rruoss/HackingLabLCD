tag_insight = "Two vulnerabilities have been discoverd in Snort, a popular network
intrusion detection system.  Snort comes with modules and plugins that
perform a variety of functions such as protocol analysis.  The
following issues have been identified:

Heap overflow in Snort stream4 preprocessor
(VU#139129, CVE-2003-0209, Bugtraq Id 7178)

Researchers at CORE Security Technologies have discovered a
remotely exploitable inteter overflow that results in overwriting
the heap in the stream4 preprocessor module.  This module allows
Snort to reassemble TCP packet fragments for further analysis.  An
attacker could insert arbitrary code that would be executed as
the user running Snort, probably root.

Buffer overflow in Snort RPC preprocessor
(VU#916785, CVE-2003-0033, Bugtraq Id 6963)

Researchers at Internet Security Systems X-Force have discovered a
remotely exploitable buffer overflow in the Snort RPC preprocessor
module.  Snort incorrectly checks the lengths of what is being
normalized against the current packet size.  An attacker could
exploit this to execute arbitrary code under the privileges of the
Snort process, probably root.

For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.8.4beta1-3.1.

The old stable distribution (potato) is not affected by these problems
since it doesn't contain the problematic code.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.0-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your snort package immediately.";
