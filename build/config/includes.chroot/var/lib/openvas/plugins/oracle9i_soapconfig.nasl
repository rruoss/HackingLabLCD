access some configuration files. These file includes detailed
information on how the product was installed in the server
including where the SOAP provider and service manager are located
as well as administrative URLs to access them. They might also
contain sensitive information (usernames and passwords for database
access).";

cannot retrieve it. Note however that if the XSQLServlet is present
it might bypass filesystem restrictions.
